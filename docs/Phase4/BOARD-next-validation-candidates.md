## The `-tests` reference-closure family — CLOSED (2026-07-27)

`DisableTransitiveProjectReferences=true` means the generated test project lists only the imports
the converter computed, so any package named by a type the test code merely *touches* is missing
and the build fails with **CS0012**. `crypto/hmac` was the first case solved (interface embedding);
the closure is now **generalized to the declaration edges of the types the compilation names**
(`declarationClosureImports`), covering both an interface's bases and a struct's field types. Full
rule, minimality gates and guards: `docs/ConversionStrategies-Reference.md`, *Reference closure (the
declaration-edge rule)*.

| Package | Missing type | Outcome |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `image/draw` | `rand_package.Rand` | **build unblocked** — a `struct` field of `quick.Config` reached at an element-bearing composite literal. Now **validated 9/9** (2026-07-31), once the two runtime defects below were fixed. |
| `io` | `io_package.Writer` | **NOT a closure defect** — see the next section. Adding the reference cannot fix it. |

**Minimality is the hard part, and it is measured, not asserted.** Regenerating all 60 banked
packages' `.tests.csproj` and diffing is the instrument, and it rejected three looser rules before
the landed one. Seeding from *every* file rather than the compiled ones drifted `compress/gzip`
(context, crypto/tls, mime/multipart, net/http, net/url — reached through `http.Request`'s fields,
from a Phase-4D-excluded `example_test.go` that is never compiled) and `go/token` (go/ast); firing
the struct edge on any *value use* drifted eleven more (`sync.Once`, `sync.Map`, `reflect.Value`);
firing it on an *empty* literal still drifted three, because an empty Go literal converts to
`new Δsync.Once(nil)` — go2cs-gen's nil constructor, which names no field. The landed rule drifts
**zero** of the 60.

⚠ **Run that probe with the converter's exit status checked.** A conversion that *fails* writes no
csproj, so an ignored failure reads exactly like "no drift" — a false-clean of the same family as
charter §9's false-green traps. That is how a real defect in the first cut hid through three
measurement rounds: a struct literal declared in the EXTERNAL test variant reached
`reach(<pkg>_test)`, a synthetic path that resolves to no importable package, and every affected
package died with F14b's `resolve test project dependency "bytes_test": package bytes_test is not
in std` — silently, until the validated sweep failed on `bytes` at the second package.

## `io` — duplicate-type build blocker CLOSED (2026-07-30); runtime blockers remain

The diagnosis was correct: recompiling `io` into its mixed internal/external test assembly created a second `io_package.Writer`, distinct from the one named by `hash.Hash`, `bytes`, `fmt`, and the rest of the referenced closure. The general fix is the new **`whitebox-reference`** test-project model. A production package with build-selected same-package tests conditionally grants friend access to `<assembly>.tests`; internal `_test.go` declarations emit into `<name>_internal_test_package`; external references to those declarations route to the bridge by `go/types.Object` identity; and test-contributed adapters live in the test metadata anchor. Production remains the only identity for its types. Records that truly require a production-type mutation still fall back to `recompile`.

Fresh `io` conversion now emits `testProjectModel: whitebox-reference`, references `io.csproj`, compiles no production `.cs` into `io.tests`, and builds with **0 errors**. The host runs all **54** included test functions: **45 pass**, proving the former CS0012/CS1503 wall is gone. `io` is not banked or counted as validated yet; the remaining nine top-level verdicts are separate runtime/semantic roots:

- `TestMultiReaderFlatten` and `TestMultiWriterSingleChainFlatten`: `runtime.getcallersp` is unimplemented — owned by the charter's reflection Phase-3 chip.
- `TestOffsetWriter_Seek`, `TestOffsetWriter_WriteAt`, `TestWriteAt_PositionPriorToBase`, plus `TestOffsetWriter_Write` subtests: `os.runtime_rand` is unimplemented in the tempfile path — owned by the `os` operational arc.
- `TestMultiWriter_StringCheckCall`: `WriteString` forwarding behavior mismatch (separate runtime/conversion investigation).
- `TestMultiWriter_WriteStringSingleAlloc` and `TestPipeAllocations`: exact allocation-profile assertions; no disclosure ruling has been made.

This board item is complete at its stated architectural boundary. The remaining rows must be handled by their owning arcs rather than folded into the test-project-model change.
## Build-blocked, each its own root

| Package | First diagnostic | Note |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `image/jpeg` | `CS0111: Type 'jpeg_package' already defines a member called 'init'` | two `init` functions merged into one class |
| `index/suffixarray` | `CS0206: A non ref-returning property or indexer may not be used as an out or ref value` | an indexer passed by `ref`/`out` |
| ~~`internal/zstd`~~ | ~~`CS1929: 'testing_package.B' … 'Cleanup'`~~ | **DONE 2026-07-27 — 534/534, banked.** The `common` members are on `core/testing`'s `B`; see the retraction below. |
| `crypto/md5` | `CS0030: Cannot convert type 'System.Type' to 'uint'` | uninvestigated |
| `path/filepath` | `CS0103: The name 'ßÅælstat' does not exist` | a mangled identifier — encoding of a non-ASCII or symbol-marked name |
| `net` | `CS1031: Type expected` | a hard syntax error in emission |

## Runtime failures

| Package | State |
|:--|:--|
| ~~`hash/maphash`~~ | **DONE 2026-07-29 — 22/22, banked.** Computed float constants that directly use a named untyped integer wrapper now materialize once at the destination's float width; `TestSmhasherAvalanche`'s mean is 50000 and the full SMHasher matrix matches Go. |
| `compress/flate` | **63 of 64.** Only `TestWriterReset`, a whole-`Writer` `reflect.DeepEqual` after `Reset`. Uninvestigated. |
| `image/gif` | **27 of 28** (2026-07-31). Only `TestWriter`, and its message names the cause: `../testdata/video-001.png image: unknown format`. `writer_test.go` blank-imports `_ "image/png"` purely for the side effect of its `init()` registering the PNG decoder with `image.Decode`; that module initializer never runs, so the format registry is empty. This is the blank-import module-initializer gap — its own board item, not an `image/gif` defect. |
| `image/png` | probed previously; does not validate |
| ~~`image/draw`~~ | **DONE 2026-07-31 — 9/9, banked.** All four failures were two defects, both fixed at the root. `TestDraw` was the address-taken *value parameter* box-copy: `DrawMask`'s `clip(dst, &r, src, &sp, mask, &mp)` narrows all three in place, and `Ꮡ(r)` boxed a COPY, so the draw loop ran on the unclipped rectangle. (The empty-`Pix` panic above was that same unclipped geometry, not an assertion defect — the guess in this row was wrong.) The other three were value adapters carrying no Go dynamic type, so `image.Image` type switches took the wrong arm. |

## Recurring classes worth a general fix rather than another point repair

- **Zero-value construction for a type that needs one.** Fixed **four** times now in four different
  emission paths: a heap-boxed local fixed array, `new([N]T)` dropping its length, `make([]S, n)`
  where `S` carries a fixed-array field, and (2026-07-27) `make` of a **defined** slice type, whose
  go2cs-gen wrapper has no element-factory constructor — `internal/fmtsort`'s
  `make(SortedMap, 0, n)` emitted a lambda into an `nint` parameter (CS1660). That fourth one was
  **live on master**, not latent, and it took 20 of 61 banked packages down in a single sweep:
  `-tests` regenerates production `.cs` on every run, so the one package that regenerated a broken
  `sort.cs` broke every later package downstream of `fmt` in the same tree. Residue: a `default!`
  zero-var local. Every *new* emission path re-opens this class, which argues for centralizing
  zero-value construction instead of patching sites — this is now the fourth data point for that.
- **Untyped constants in a typed slot — CLOSED 2026-07-29.** The int-literal case was already fixed;
  a computed float constant that directly uses a named untyped integer wrapper now folds once at the
  resolved float width. `hash/maphash` validates 22/22; `UntypedConstDefine` guards both `:=` and typed slots.

## RETRACTED — the `internal/zstd` / `testing.B` "trap" was a false alarm

`internal/zstd` is worth **534 verdicts**, and the fix is what it looked like: Go's `B` and `T` both
embed `common`, so a benchmark body may call `Cleanup`, `Error`, `Log`, `Name`, `TempDir` and the
rest, while `core/testing`'s compile-only `B` surface declared almost none of them. Adding the
missing `common` members makes `internal/zstd` validate at **534/534** — banked 2026-07-27.

**Two claims previously recorded here are wrong, and both were re-measured on master before the
retraction:**

1. *"Completing `B`'s surface breaks `crypto/hmac`."* It does not. With all 14 members added,
   `crypto/hmac` regenerates with its `<ProjectReference … io.csproj />` intact and validates at
   **172/172**. The stated mechanism cannot hold: `core/testing` is hand-owned **C#**, the closure
   is computed in **Go** from `go/types`, and the converter never reads the shim — no edit to
   `testing.cs` can change a byte of converter output. (Adding *extension* methods would not make
   `B` implement `TB` in C# either.)
2. *"`crypto/hmac`'s closure is not reproducible from a standalone regeneration."* It is. Deleting
   `crypto.hmac.tests.csproj` outright and re-running the pipeline on the committed tree
   regenerates it byte-identically, `io.csproj` included, with and without the `B` members.

The likely origin of both is charter §9's false-alarm trap (a): a `bin/go2cs.exe` built before
`60f99c505` — the commit that added the interface-base closure, and the one *immediately* before
hmac's banking commit — regenerates hmac without the io reference and fails exactly as described.
**Lesson to carry forward:** when a change in one language appears to alter output produced by
another, force `go build -o bin/go2cs.exe` and re-measure before recording a coupling.
