# DESIGN — the Go-format crash report for an unhandled panic

## 1. What Go prints

Go's runtime writes a crash report to standard error and dies with exit status 2. Its shape is
recorded verbatim in Go's own test source (`runtime/debug/stack_test.go`, the comment above
`TestSetCrashOutput`'s read-back):

```
panic: oops

goroutine 1 [running]:
runtime/debug_test.TestMain(0x1400007e0a0)
	GOROOT/src/runtime/debug/stack_test.go:33 +0x18c
main.main()
	_testmain.go:71 +0x170
```

Four elements, in order:

1. `panic: ` followed by the panic **value**, rendered by Go's `preprintpanics` rule — an `error`
   prints its `Error()`, a `fmt.Stringer` its `String()`, anything else its `%v` form.
2. A **blank line**.
3. `goroutine N [running]:`
4. The traceback — one `<pkg>.<Func>()` line per frame, each followed by a tab-indented
   `<file>:<line>`.

Elements 3 and 4 are *exactly* what converted `debug.Stack()` already produces, and that production
is banked: `runtime/debug`'s `TestStack` compares four converted frames against Go's own
expectations — package path, receiver spelling, Go file and Go line — and agrees on all four (the
fifth is the ruled `host-limit` frame). Element 1 is exactly what `PanicException.PanicText` already
computes, and it is banked by the `PanicValueRendering` behavioral test. **This arc composes banked
ingredients; it renders nothing new.**

Two properties of Go's report that the composition must preserve, because `TestSetCrashOutput` pins
them:

* The report goes to stderr **in addition to** whatever the program itself wrote there. The child
  in that test does `println("hello")` before panicking, and Go's stderr carries both.
* When `debug.SetCrashOutput(f, …)` is in force, the report **also** goes to `f` — and `f` receives
  the report and *nothing else*. `hello` must not be in the crash file.

## 2. Where it lands, and where it does not

The wrong answer is `runtime/debug`. `SetCrashOutput` is only the *destination* half; the text
`TestSetCrashOutput` reads is chosen by whatever prints when a panic escapes, and today that is a
.NET framing produced in two places:

| Site | What it prints today |
|:--|:--|
| `golib` — `builtin.InitializeGoLib`'s `AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException` backstop | `panic: <value>` — the first line only, then `Environment.Exit(2)` |
| `core/testing` — `TestHost.Run`'s outer `catch (Exception ex)` | `ex.ToString()`, i.e. `System.AggregateException: One or more errors occurred. (oops) ---> go.PanicException: oops` over a CLR frame list, then `return 2` |

Both are "the host deciding what an escaped panic prints", and both must print the same report.
That is the whole blast radius, and it is corpus-wide by construction: golib's backstop is the
terminal path for *every* converted program's unhandled panic, including one that escapes a
goroutine.

**A recovered panic is untouched.** Nothing on the recover path, the `GoFrame` capture/claim
protocol, or the per-test panic report in `TestExecution` changes; only a panic that has already
lost every chance to be recovered reaches the printer.

## 3. The printer, and how it reaches a Go-spelled traceback

The printer is **`go.golib.CrashReport`** — golib, because golib is the only assembly both the test
host and every converted program share (`core/testing` references golib and `time`, and nothing
else).

golib cannot spell a Go frame name or map a converted `.cs` line back to its Go position: that
machinery — `goFrameName`, the receiver qualifier, `goFramePosition` and the position-map decode —
lives in `core/runtime`'s `managed_impl.cs`, which sits **above** golib. The dependency is therefore
inverted exactly as `RuntimeErrorPanic.IntegerDivideByZeroValue` already inverts it for the
divide-by-zero panic value: **golib declares the hook, `core/runtime` fills it from its own module
initializer.** That precedent is banked (math/bits' `TestDiv32PanicZero`) and its write-up states
this design's fallback rule in so many words — *"when nothing has registered … the panic falls back
to the plain message below, which still reads and prints identically."*

So:

* `CrashReport.TracebackRenderer` — `Func<PanicException, Exception, string>?`, installed by
  `core/runtime`'s existing `[ModuleInitializer]`. It returns elements 3 and 4 as one block, from
  the *same* `appendGoFrames` that `runtime.Stack` uses. No second renderer exists.
* With no renderer registered, the report is `panic: <value>` and nothing more — **byte-identical
  to what golib prints today**. An uninstalled renderer is therefore a strict non-regression, never
  a wrong report, and never a Go-shaped header over frames golib could only spell in .NET.

The alternative — relocating the ~400 lines of traceback machinery from `managed_impl.cs` into
golib so no hook is needed — was considered and refused: it rewrites machinery banked hours earlier
(rows #160–#161) for no behavior any consumer can observe, and the inverted hook is the
repository's already-ruled idiom for precisely this layering.

### Which stack the traceback comes from

`PanicTrace` first, then the exception that actually travelled:

* `PanicTrace` is the origin snapshot taken at the first `GoFrame` catch. It is the right answer
  whenever a panic passed through a deferred sequence, because re-raising a stored instance resets
  `Exception.StackTrace` to the re-raise point.
* When no frame ever caught it — a `panic()` in a function with no defer, which is exactly
  `TestMain`'s shape in `TestSetCrashOutput` — `PanicTrace` is null and the travelling exception
  still carries the throw site.
* For a synthesized runtime-error panic (nil dereference, divide by zero) the `PanicException` was
  never thrown at all, so the **original** .NET exception is the one with frames. That is why the
  renderer takes both the panic and the exception that travelled, rather than only the panic.

### `goroutine N`

The header is `goroutine 1 [running]:` — inherited verbatim from `runtime.Stack`, not decided here.
golib's goroutine ids are deliberately opaque and are not Go's numbering, so this arc reuses the
banked convention rather than minting a number. A panic on a non-main goroutine therefore reports
`goroutine 1`; that divergence predates this arc, is guarded where it is observable
(`sync`'s `TestOnceFuncPanicTraceback`), and retires with goroutine identity numbering, not here.

## 4. The tee — `SetCrashOutput`'s fd

The slot already exists: `runtime/debug`'s hand-owned `runtime_setCrashFD` remembers an fd and is
inert. It moves to golib (`CrashReport.SetCrashOutputFd`), keeping Go's contract exactly — swap,
return the previous value, `^uintptr(0)` means unset — and `runtime_setCrashFD` forwards to it.
That placement is *more* faithful than the status quo, not less: in Go the slot lives in `runtime`
(`runtime.crashFD`, reached by `//go:linkname runtime_setCrashFD runtime.setCrashFD`), and golib is
this project's runtime library.

`CrashReport.Report` writes the composed report to stderr and, when the slot holds an fd, to that
fd as well. The asymmetry `TestSetCrashOutput` pins falls out of that and needs no rule: program
output reaches stderr through `println`/`os.Stderr` and never through this path, so the crash fd
only ever receives what `Report` hands it.

The fd is a real OS handle on both platform shapes (Windows: a `DuplicateHandle` result;
Unix: a dup'd descriptor), which is what `SafeFileHandle` means on each, so one `FileStream` over a
non-owning `SafeFileHandle` serves both. The handle is not closed — `SetCrashOutput` owns it, and
Go's own comment explains why it must outlive the caller's `File`.

## 5. Exit code

**Unchanged: 2.** golib already exits 2; the test host already returns 2. Nothing about process
termination moves, including the `finally` that removes the isolated run directory.

## 6. Blast radius, measured

Every converted program's unhandled-panic stderr gains lines. The **first line does not change** —
it is `panic: <value>` before and after — and that is the property every existing comparison rests
on:

* `BehavioralRunner`'s Output phase compares exit codes, full stdout, and **the first line of
  stderr only** (`Program.cs`, `FirstLine`, which also trims a trailing `\r`). Its own comment gives
  the reason: "Go's panic report appends a machine-specific goroutine stack trace, so a full
  comparison can never match; the first line carries the deterministic report." Adding elements 2–4
  *below* the first line therefore leaves every comparison's input identical, while the added lines
  match Go's shape where previously there were none.
* Census of behavioral projects containing `panic(` at all: 28, of which 19 recover. The guard
  written for this surface is **`GoroutinePanicExitCode`**, whose own header documents the
  first-line contract and asserts exit 2 with the report on stderr rather than stdout. No behavioral
  project carries a stderr **golden**; the comparison is against `go run` at run time, so there is
  nothing to re-baseline.
* No committed artifact anywhere in `src/tests` or `src/core` contains the string
  `System.AggregateException`, so nothing expects the framing being removed.
* Across the banked roster's committed test sources, exactly one file mentions `panic: ` as text —
  `regexp/exec_test.cs`, where it is a `fmt.Errorf` format string of the test's own making, not an
  observation of this surface.

The verification standard for the gate: any Output-phase movement in the full behavioral suite is
investigated **by name**. A comparison that moves *toward* Go is still a movement to be explained,
and a comparison that moves away is a defect.

## 7. Adversarial review (charter §7)

Three lenses, each a way the printer could make things worse than the dump it replaces.

**(a) A panic *during* the crash print.** The printer runs on a process that is already dying, and
it must never replace the panic's report with a report about the printer. So: the stderr write
happens **first** and independently, the tee is separately guarded, and every part of `Report` is
inside a `catch`-all that falls back to the single `panic: <value>` line. The renderer is invoked
inside that guard too — a renderer that throws (a hostile `MethodBase`, an assembly whose attributes
will not load) costs the traceback, never the report. `Environment.Exit(2)` is reached on every
path, including the failing ones, because the exit is sequenced after the printer and not inside it.
This is the same posture `readGoPositionMaps` already takes ("a traceback is diagnostic output, and
it must not be the thing that takes a program down").

**(b) A panic value whose rendering itself panics.** Already solved and deliberately reused rather
than reimplemented: `PanicException.Message` computes `PanicText(State)` once, lazily, inside a
`try` that answers `"panic while printing panic value"` — Go's own words for the same event. The
printer reads `Message`; it never touches `State`. Two consequences worth stating: the substitution
still happens exactly once and exactly at the moment Go performs it (`preprintpanics` runs only for
a panic that is about to be printed, which is precisely this path), and a recovered panic still
never invokes a user `Error()`/`String()` at all.

**(c) Double panic / recover, and the panic-ownership doctrine.** The printer is a **reader**. It
touches none of `GoFuncRoot`'s three slots — `CapturedPanic`, `HandledPanic`, `UnclaimedPanic` — and
does not call `recover()`, `GoFrame.Run`, `ArmPanicClaim` or `ClaimPanic`. It reads
`PanicException.PanicTrace`, which is set at capture and inherited on re-panic, and it reads it
only after every frame has declined to recover. A re-panic from a deferred call therefore reaches
the printer as one panic carrying the *original* origin — which is what Go's traceback shows for
the same program — and the frame-owned re-raise protocol is unchanged in both mechanism and
ordering. The one behavior that changes for the test host is that its outer `catch` stops
*describing* an escaped panic as an infrastructure error and starts *reporting* it as Go does; the
catch itself stays, so the `finally` still tears down the isolated run directory, and a genuine
infrastructure exception is still reported the way it always was.

## 8. Deliberately not in scope

* Go's `[recovered]` annotation and its nested-panic chain (`panic: A [recovered]\n\tpanic: B`).
  Nothing measures it; adding it would be invention.
* Frame argument words (`(0x1400007e0a0)`) and PC offsets (`+0x18c`). The banked frame rendering
  omits both and `TestStack` agrees with Go without them.
* `all goroutines` dumps. `runtime.Stack(buf, true)` cannot honestly answer them under the CLR (no
  supported cross-thread stack walk); that refusal is recorded at `runtime.Stack` and stands.
* Goroutine identity numbering — see §3.

## 9. Gates

golib and test-host change class, so:

| Gate | Why |
|:--|:--|
| `GolibTests`, with the new printer guards proven **failing-first** | format exactness including the blank line, the fallback shape, the tee asymmetry, and exit-code preservation |
| Full behavioral suite (`run-behavioral.ps1`) | golib is linked by everything; any Output-phase movement investigated by name |
| `go2cs.slnx --no-incremental`, 0 errors | the only gate that compiles the non-generated solution members after a golib/runtime API change |
| `runtime/debug` pipeline, `-test-action all` | the row this arc exists for: `TestSetCrashOutput` must pass all six assertions |
