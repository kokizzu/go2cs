    // A C# nested type declared with no access modifier is PRIVATE, and the `[GoType]`
    // declarations in this package's converted sources are deliberately bare so they read
    // like the Go original. Their real accessibility — public for a Go-exported name,
    // internal otherwise — is supplied by the partial that go2cs-gen's TypeGenerator emits,
    // and a source generator cannot see its own output: while the generators run, every one
    // of those types is still private, so a semantic query that reaches across package
    // classes resolves them as Inaccessible and silently drops whatever it was about to
    // build from them.

    // The declarations below close that gap. A C# partial type may carry its access modifier
    // on any ONE of its parts, so pinning it here fixes each type's accessibility IN SOURCE,
    // ahead of generation, while the `[GoType]` declaration itself stays Go-shaped — the
    // section declares `public partial interface Closer {}` for a `[GoType] partial interface
    // Closer`, and `internal partial struct dirEntry {}` for an unexported one.
