// For encountered type alias declarations, e.g., `type Table = map[string]int`,
// go2cs code converter will generate a `global using` statement for the alias in
// the converted source, e.g.: `global using Table = go.map<go.@string, nint>;`.
// Although scope of `global using` is available to all files in the project, all
// converted Go code for the project targets the same package, so `global using`
// statements will effectively have package level scope.

// Additionally, `GoTypeAlias` attributes will be generated here for exported type
// aliases. This allows the type alias to be imported and used from other packages
// when referenced.

// As types are cast to interfaces in Go source code, the go2cs code converter
// will generate an assembly level `GoImplement` attribute for each unique cast.
// This allows the interface to be implemented in the C# source code using source
// code generation (see go2cs-gen). An alternate interface implementation exists
// that can resolve duck-typed interfaces at run-time, but handling interface
// implementations at compile-time results in faster startup times, avoiding
// reflection-based interface resolution.
