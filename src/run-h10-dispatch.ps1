# run-h10-dispatch.ps1 - the H10 per-row dispatch driver.
#
# Reads the MACHINE-READABLE plan emitted by docs/phase4/hopA-inputs/shardmap.py --emit-plan and runs
# one worker's rows, in order, slice by slice, with the ruled cooldown gap between slices. Coordinator
# ruling e0d5121e2 section 7: "an H10 dispatch script that reads the emitted map and runs a worker's
# rows in order with the cooldown gaps of section 4 -- C2 designs it, i9 accepts it on one slice."
#
# Design record: docs/phase4/DESIGN-h10-dispatch-driver.md. Read that before changing anything here;
# the three refusals below are the whole point of the script and each one is there because the
# alternative fails SILENTLY.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THIS READS A TSV AND NOT THE MAP REPORT
#
# The generator's stdout is a report for a human and it defeats a parser three ways, each silently
# (measured 2026-09-13):
#
#   1. the row lists WRAP at column 118, so a line is not a record;
#   2. worker names carry SPACES and PARENTHESES ("i9-13900K (sweeper)"), so whitespace is not a
#      delimiter;
#   3. the SAME worker appears in EVERY `W` section with a DIFFERENT row set -- R-LAPTOP holds 85 rows
#      at W=3 and 60 at W=4 -- so a driver grepping its own worker name takes whichever section comes
#      first and dispatches 25 rows it was not assigned, with nothing anywhere reading wrong.
#
# So: `W` is a required parameter and a COLUMN in the plan. A driver that does not say which fleet size
# it is dispatching gets NO rows and a refusal, never the wrong ones.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE COOLDOWN IS BETWEEN SLICES, NOT BETWEEN ROWS
#
# Ruled at 4327ab7e1 section 2: slice cap 40 minutes, ten-minute cooldown, two slices and one gap for
# the i9's reserved leg. The cap is a BLAST-RADIUS limit on a box with one recorded thermal death, not
# a performance tuning knob -- and `-ShardCount`'s own comment says the gap belongs to the caller,
# which is this script. Both numbers are READ FROM THE PLAN rather than written here, so the ruling
# lives in one place and a plan generated under a different cap dispatches under that cap.
#
# A row is INDIVISIBLE: the sweep's unit of dispatch is a package. crypto/dsa alone is 1,317 s, which
# is why no cap below 21.95 minutes can exist, and why a slice holding one over-cap row is legal.
