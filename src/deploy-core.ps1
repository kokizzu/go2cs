<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Deploys the go2cs core libraries to the standard root %GOPATH%\src\go2cs so that
    converted projects (and, later, recursively converted end-user apps that target the
    same root) can lean on relative $(go2csPath) project references.

.DESCRIPTION
    Stages src\core -- the converted Go standard library, the shared golib runtime and the
    hand-owned packages -- at <root>\core\<pkg>, and the source-generator/analyzer at
    <root>\gen\go2cs-gen, then writes a Directory.Build.props at <root> pinning $(go2csPath) to
    that root. Because every generated .csproj references its dependencies as
    $(go2csPath)core\<pkg> / $(go2csPath)gen\go2cs-gen, that single props file makes the whole
    deployed tree -- and anything a recursive conversion later drops under the same root --
    resolve without any per-build -p:go2csPath flag.

    The deployed layout is IDENTICAL to the repository layout: since the converted standard
    library moved home to src\core (2026-08-01) there is one tree and one path scheme, so this
    script no longer has stub/stdlib modes and no longer rewrites any project reference.

.PARAMETER Target
    Deploy root. Defaults to <GOPATH>\src\go2cs (GOPATH from `go env GOPATH`).

.PARAMETER Configuration
    Build configuration used by the verify build. Defaults to Debug.

.PARAMETER NoBuild
    Copy + wire up only; skip the verify build.

.PARAMETER WhatIf
    Dry run: report exactly what would be cleaned, copied and written, and change nothing. The
    deploy root defaults to %GOPATH%\src\go2cs, which is MACHINE-GLOBAL and shared with every other
    checkout on the box -- so a change to this script has to be provable without deploying. Pair it
    with -Target <scratch dir> for an end-to-end test that touches nothing anyone else can see.

# and nothing else -- no mirroring, no deletion. The destination is cleaned by the caller first,
# exactly as before, so /MIR semantics were never in play.
