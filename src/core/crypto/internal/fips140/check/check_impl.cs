// Hand-written body for crypto/internal/fips140/check's init (R, COORD ruling 2026-09-22).
//
// WHY. The FIPS 140 integrity check HMACs the module's text and rodata sections, located through
// `Linkinfo`, a `go:fipsinfo` symbol the GO LINKER synthesizes (cmd/link/internal/ld/fips.go): the
// hash is a property of the Go BUILD's layout, not of the algorithms under test, and a CLR assembly
// carries no fips140 module sections, so there is nothing to hash and no linker to write the sum.
//
// WHAT WENT WRONG. Converted faithfully, `Linkinfo` is a ZERO-valued struct, so whenever
// fips140.Enabled (GODEBUG=fips140=on) the static initializer panicked `fips140: no verification
// checksum found`, and the section loop beyond it would HMAC `unsafe.Slice` bounds a managed
// assembly does not have. MEASURED: the re-exec'd GODEBUG=fips140=on child of TestCASTPasses,
// TestCASTFailures and TestConditionals died in that initializer -- 44 of
// crypto/internal/fips140test's 52 divergences.
//
// WHAT IS KEPT. Everything that is not the section hash keeps Go's shape: fips140.Enabled off
// returns at once with Verified false; an unsupported platform still panics with Go's message; the
// `#fips140=debug` line still prints; Verified is set true exactly where Go sets it. The CAST
// self-tests the suite exercises live in their own packages and are untouched. `Linkinfo`,
// `fipsMagic` and `zeroSum` stay auto-converted for any reader of the exported symbol.
