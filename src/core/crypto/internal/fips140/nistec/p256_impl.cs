// WHAT WENT WRONG. Go 1.24 replaced a runtime-computed generator table with an EMBEDDED one and
// takes a free view over it:
//
//     p256GeneratorTables = (*[43]p256AffineTable)(unsafe.Pointer(&p256PrecomputedEmbed))
//
// The converter emitted that literally, as `(ж<array<p256AffineTable>>)(uintptr)(...FromPinnedBox
// (Ꮡp256PrecomputedEmbed))`. golib's `array<T>` is a `readonly struct` whose FIRST field is
// `T[] m_array`, and a generated `[GoType("[N]E")]` type is a struct holding a `StrongBox<array<E>>`
// -- so the raw-address route lays a MANAGED HEADER over the table's own DATA and the first eight
// bytes become a reference. It is not latent: MEASURED at the version tip, SystemCertVerify dies
// `0xC0000005` on the first `.at<>()`, ten frames deep, in `ecdsa.GenerateKey` -> `ScalarBaseMult`
// -> `nistec.Select` -> `DerefOrNull` -> `ElemRefBox<p256AffineTable>.get_ValueSlot`, and the
// program never reaches the certificate seam it exists to test.
//
// ⚠ WHY NOT THE HOUSE SEAM. q97 cured the same SHAPE in sha3 with `MemoryMarshal.Cast` over the
// array's own span, and that does not work here. `Cast` is constrained `where T : struct`, NOT
// `where T : unmanaged`: it compiles for any struct and does a RUNTIME reference check. MEASURED --
// `MemoryMarshal.Cast<byte, p256AffineTable>` builds with 0 errors and throws
// `ArgumentException: Only value types without pointers or references are supported` inside the
// module initializer. Every generated Go array type is a managed struct by construction, so no
// AGGREGATE Go array type can be cast into; q97's worked because its destination was a PRIMITIVE
// (`byte` -> `uint64`). The general cure -- the converter emitting a typed managed-backed view for
// this shape -- is post-hop work and is NOT what this file is.
//
// SO THIS IS A COPY, AND A COPY IS CORRECT HERE. MEASURED: `p256GeneratorTables` is written once,
// in this init, and read at exactly two sites (`ScalarBaseMult`'s two table lookups); nothing else
// in the corpus touches it. q97's sponge REQUIRED a genuine alias because absorb and squeeze share
// the buffer between permutations -- this table does not, and Go aliases it purely to avoid copying
// 88,064 bytes once at startup. The copy happens one time, in a module initializer.
//
// ⚠ BOTH ARMS, and the endianness branch is GONE rather than skipped. Go's function has a
// `cpu.BigEndian` arm that rebuilds the table through `byteorder.LEUint64` -- it exists because
// Go's alias is HOST-NATIVE, so on a big-endian host the embedded little-endian limbs would be
// misread. This decode reads every limb with an EXPLICIT little-endian read, so it is already
// correct on every host and the branch has nothing left to do. That is how `:577`, the big-endian
// arm's own `(ж<array<array<byte>>>)(uintptr)` reinterpret, is cured: not left behind, but
// subsumed. (`cpu.BigEndian` is a `const bool = false` in this corpus, so the arm was also
// unreachable -- but the decode does not depend on that being true.)
//
// The view is taken over the BOX'S OWN WINDOW (`ToSpan()` honours `m_low`/`m_length`), never a raw
// address, so a table that ever changed size surfaces as a bounds failure here rather than as
// corruption at first use.
//
// ⚠ SCOPE: this is a SITE cure, not the class cure. C1's census at the version tip found a whole
// class of pinned-box reinterpretations at a different pointee, with the crash site itself among
// them -- so the campaign keeps looking, and this file fixes exactly one table.
//
// ⚠ AND THE BOUND WITHIN THAT SCOPE (C2): `p256_asm.go` carries the IDENTICAL reinterpret at its
// own line 332, and it is not cured here because it is not in this corpus -- under the corpus's own
// default tags (`purego,math_big_pure_go`) this package selects only `p256.go`,
// `p256_ordinv_noasm.go` and `p256_table.go`. So the cure is complete FOR THE CORPUS AS SELECTED,
// and a tag-set change that admits the asm variant brings a second site of the same shape with it.
//
// COST, stated because nobody had: the alias viewed 88,064 bytes in place, and this decode allocates
// 2,752 `P256Element`s each holding an `array<uint64>(4)` -- roughly twice the bytes plus per-object
// headers, once, in a module initializer. Worth knowing; not worth trading the crash for.
