// Package entropy provides the passive entropy source for the FIPS 140-3
// module. It is only used in FIPS mode by [crypto/internal/fips140/drbg.Read].
//
// This complies with IG 9.3.A, Additional Comment 12, which until January 1,
// 2026 allows new modules to meet an [earlier version] of Resolution 2(b):
// "A software module that contains an approved DRBG that receives a LOAD
// command (or its logical equivalent) with entropy obtained from [...] inside
// the physical perimeter of the operational environment of the module [...]."
//
// Distributions that have their own SP 800-90B entropy source should replace
// this package with their own implementation.
