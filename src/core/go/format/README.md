Package format implements standard formatting of Go source.

Note that formatting of Go source code changes over time, so tools relying on consistent formatting should execute a specific version of the gofmt binary instead of using this package. That way, the formatting will be stable, and the tools won't need to be recompiled each time gofmt changes.

For example, pre-submit checks that use this package directly would behave differently depending on what Go version each developer uses, causing the check to be inherently fragile.
