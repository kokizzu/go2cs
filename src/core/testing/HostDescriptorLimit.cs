/// syscall's TestPrlimitFileLimit (syscall_linux_test.go:720-734) lowers the process's SOFT
/// RLIMIT_NOFILE to 43 and never restores the process limit: its deferred Store puts back only
/// syscall's cached origRlimitNofile pointer. A Go test binary lives inside 43 descriptors for the rest
/// of its run. The managed test host does not: the CLR's own thread start needs descriptors the lowered
/// limit no longer admits, so the NEXT test's goroutine start threw OutOfMemoryException out of
/// Thread.StartCore and the host died with 19 of syscall's rows unrun (go1.24.13 Linux leg,
/// claude/g-linux-leg-evidence b84e5d5bfa). The mechanism is measured by GolibTests'
/// LinuxDescriptorLimitTests.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The limit a test SETS is still the limit that test RUNS under, so a test that asserts on it reads
/// exactly what Go reads; only the NEXT test starts from the limit the run started with. The HARD limit
/// is never raised: a restore that the kernel refuses (a test that lowered the hard limit below the
/// snapshot's soft value) is reported back to the caller rather than retried.
