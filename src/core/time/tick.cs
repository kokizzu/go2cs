// Hand-finished conversion (tick.go — Ticker construction and control).
//
// Go allocates a Ticker inside the RUNTIME and reaches it by reinterpreting the *Timer that
// runtime.newTimer returned — "Ticker and Timer have the same layout, so that newTimer can handle
// both":
//
//     t := (*Ticker)(unsafe.Pointer(newTimer(when(d), int64(d), sendTime, c, syncTimer(c))))
//     ...
//     stopTimer((*Timer)(unsafe.Pointer(t)))
//
// The literal conversion of those three reinterprets COMPILES but cannot work in a managed runtime.
// Each is a `(ж<U>)(uintptr)(unsafe.Pointer(Ꮡbox))` round-trip, and golib's managed-box
// `ж<T> → uintptr` operator returns `fixed (void* ptr = &value.Value) (uintptr)ptr` — an address
// whose pin ends with that statement. The derived box holds only the bare address and NO reference
// to the source box, so the ticker's storage is (a) not kept alive at all — nothing else references
// the ж<Timer> newTimer produced, so it is collected at the next GC — and (b) not stable even if it
// were, since a compacting GC may move it. Every read of `t.C` or `t.initTicker` afterwards reads
// whatever now occupies that address. Worse, `Ticker` holds a `channel<Time>`, i.e. a MANAGED
// reference, so the storage cannot be pinned either (`GCHandle.Alloc(…, Pinned)` rejects a type
// containing references) — the raw-address model has no sound form here. See
// docs/Phase4/FINDING-managed-box-uintptr-lifetime.md, which characterizes this hazard corpus-wide;
// NewTicker is its worst case, because the derived pointer is RETAINED for the ticker's lifetime
// rather than consumed immediately.
//
// This file therefore constructs the Ticker DIRECTLY and addresses the runtime timer by the box's
// own identity, which is the project's standing ruling for managed-referent pointers ("hold the
// ж<T>/object directly, never a nuint round-trip"). Behavior is otherwise unchanged: armNewTimer /
// stopRuntimeTimer / resetRuntimeTimer (time_impl.cs) are the very entry points sleep.cs's
// newTimer / stopTimer / resetTimer call, and Go's own runtime.newTimer serves Timer and Ticker
// through one implementation for the same reason.
//
// MODELED since 2026-08-03: the `syncTimer(c)` argument. It marks the channel a SYNCHRONOUS timer
// channel (Go 1.23, #37196), which the managed timer model now implements; the call below is made
// for its nil/non-nil ANSWER, which is the mode selector, not for its pointer value. See
// SYNCHRONOUS TIMER CHANNELS in time_impl.cs for the property and the two mechanisms.
//
// REVERTIBLE: if the general managed-reinterpret capability lands (option 2 of the FINDING — a
// converter-emitted `Ꮡt.Reinterpret<U>()` aliasing the same managed slot), delete this file and let
// the converter's tick.cs.auto take over unchanged; nothing here is a semantic choice of its own.
