// Hand-written body for internal/runtime/maps' runtime fatal bridge. runtime.cs:12 carries Go's own
// header for the block, "Functions below pushed from runtime.", and :15 the bodyless partial; the
// push does not arrive in this corpus, so PartialStubGenerator fills it with a throwing
// NotImplementedException.
//
// REACH, measured at this tree: 41 call sites across six files, and every one of them is a
// corruption report — 25 `concurrent map writes`, 10 `concurrent map read and map write`, 5 `small
// map with no empty slot`, 1 `concurrent map iteration and map write`. Go's answer to each is an
// unrecoverable fatal precisely because the map's invariants are already broken and continuing is
// worse than stopping. A throwing stub turns every one of those into an ordinary exception that any
// frame above can catch and carry on from, over a map that is no longer consistent.

// WHY A COMPANION AND NOT A //go:linkname REGISTRY ROW. The converter CAN forward a push into the
// consumer package, and five of RED 7's members are being wired that way (crypto/internal/fips140's
// three, crypto/internal/sysrand's fatal and crypto/internal/fips140hash's sha3Unwrap — G's seat).
// A row is admissible only where the consumer's project ALREADY references the pushing package.
// runtime.csproj REFERENCES internal/runtime/maps, so a row in the other direction would close a
// DIRECT cycle. This member takes the companion, not the row.
// COORD's split at 1fa7940a0, on G's reading of the project files at 5bb307d57e.
//
// WHY golib HOLDS THE PRIMITIVE, and not `runtime`. golib is the only assembly BELOW every converted
// package. FatalReport.cs argues this for itself and names this very set of consumers — it was
// written for the fatal shims already known, and these are the members the 1.24 hop added to the
// same class. One primitive there, a one-line forward here.
//
// WHAT THE FORWARD PRESERVES. Go's fatal is UNRECOVERABLE from its first instruction: no recover(),
// no deferred function, no catch. FatalReport.Fatal writes `fatal error: <text>`, a blank line and a
// Go-spelled traceback, then calls Environment.Exit(2), so the unrecoverability is structural rather
// than a property of the exception type — which is exactly what a throwing stub does NOT give: a
// NotImplementedException is an ordinary managed exception any frame above can catch.
//
// userFault is Go's throwType axis, read from Go's OWN push at the pin rather than inferred:
// runtime/panic.go:1056 pushes maps_fatal, whose body is `fatal(s)` — throwTypeUser, userFault TRUE.

// Aliased rather than imported wholesale: this file needs exactly one golib type, and a blanket
// `using go.golib` would also pull that namespace's extension methods into a hand-owned file sitting
// beside converted code.
using FatalReport = go.golib.FatalReport;

// rand, the second member of the same push block (runtime.cs:18; pushed by runtime/rand.go:182,
// `maps_rand` -> `return rand()`), takes the companion for the same cycle reason. Go's runtime.rand is
// the per-m ChaCha8 generator, OS-seeded at startup and non-deterministic run to run; the map consumes
// it for per-map hash seeds and the randomized iteration start (map.go, table.go), both of which Go
// DEFINES as unpredictable. Random.Shared is that contract -- OS-entropy seeded, thread-safe, fast --
// and it is the body math/rand, math/rand/v2, net and os already give their own runtime_rand pulls
// (math/rand/v2/rand_impl.cs). Before this every NewMap reached the throwing stub: 14 of
// internal/runtime/maps' tests stopped at NotImplementedException "rand".
