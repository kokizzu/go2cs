// THE os.Root DOOR -- NtCreateFile and NtOpenFile, the two ntdll wrappers every os.Root operation
// on Windows goes through, and the hop-new members of the syscall STRUCT-PASSING class.
//
// The class, its failure mode and its remedy are documented once, in
// syscall/windows/zsyscall_windows_impl.cs, and restated for a second member in this directory's
// zsyscall_windows_version_impl.cs (rtlGetVersion), which is this file's precedent. The short form:
// a converted struct holding golib `array<T>` or `ж<T>` fields is a CLR record with MANAGED
// REFERENCES where the native record has a raw pointer or inline storage, so its address -- if it
// even has one -- does not name the bytes the kernel expects.
//
// THIS ONE, in numbers. OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES is 48 bytes on x64 (ULONG Length, 4 pad, HANDLE
// RootDirectory, PUNICODE_STRING ObjectName, ULONG Attributes, 4 pad, PVOID SecurityDescriptor,
// PVOID SecurityQualityOfService). That 48 is not read off documentation: the conversion computes
// it for itself and types_windows.cs:129 folds `unsafe.Sizeof(*o)` to the literal 48 inside
// OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES.init, which every caller runs before the call, and os/windows/root_windows.cs
// assigns the same 48 at its own site. The converted record (types_windows.cs:108) cannot have that
// layout: ObjectName, SecurityDescriptor and SecurityQoS are `ж<T>`, so it is an auto-layout object
// holding three managed references. Its ObjectName's pointee is reference-bearing too --
// NTUnicodeString.Buffer is `ж<uint16>` (string_windows.cs:11) -- which is the second level this
// file also owes.
//
// WHAT THE SITE DOES TODAY, and why this is a LOUD defect rather than a silent one. A
// reference-bearing pointee has no pinnable slot, so `(uintptr)` on its box answers an ORDER TOKEN
// rather than an address, and syscall/windows/dll_windows.cs's token door refuses it before the
// trampoline runs: "argument 2 is a managed pointer token, not an address ... Hand-own this wrapper
// against a blittable mirror (see zsyscall_windows_version_impl.cs)". That message names this file.
// i9 measured the consequence at row 48 -- the refusal is a panic, it takes goroutine 1 with it, and
// the 494 leaves behind TestRootConsistencyCreate have never had a C# side at all.
//
// WHY ARGUMENT 2 AND NOTHING ELSE. The other pointer arguments are blittable pointees and their
// boxes have real, pinned addresses: `handle` is ΔHandle (num:uintptr), `iosb` is IO_STATUS_BLOCK
// (NTStatus num:uint32 plus uintptr, types_windows.cs:102) and `allocationSize` is int64. The door
// fires at 2 and only at 2, which is the measurement that bounds this file's scope: the delta from
// each generated body is exactly ONE THING, the memory the third argument names.
//
// NO COPY OF THE PATH TEXT, deliberately. NTUnicodeString.Buffer points at UTF-16 the caller
// already holds, and uint16 IS blittable -- so that box has a pinnable slot and `(uintptr)` on it
// answers a real address, the same way the generated wrapper's own `ᴋNN` locals do. The mirror
// therefore stores that address and the wrapper KeepAlives the box across the call, which is the
// corpus's existing contract for a pointer argument, rather than inventing a second copy of the
// path with its own lifetime to get wrong.
//
// ONE DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE FROM NOTHING, stated so the parity is visible: the CALL is unchanged
// from each generated body -- the same LazyProc, the same syscall.Syscall12 / syscall.Syscall6
// arity and argument order, the same NTStatus conversion, the same discarded r2 and errno. Only
// the third argument's memory differs. rtlGetVersion's header gives the reason to keep the
// generated trampoline rather than reach for [LibraryImport]: Go resolves ntdll.dll through
// sysdll.Add, which pins the load to the system directory.
