// The TOKEN-INFORMATION members of the native-boundary class, in internal/syscall/windows --- the
// UNREPAIRED TWINS of members cured one package over.
//
// The class, its failure mode and its remedy are documented once, in
// syscall/windows/security_windows.cs (getInfo, GetTokenUser, GetTokenPrimaryGroup); that file is
// the reference and this one does not restate it. Its own words for the fork: not a wrapper handing
// the kernel a non-blittable struct by ADDRESS, and not a wrapper with a `**T` OUT-parameter, but a
// KERNEL BYTE BUFFER THE CALLER REINTERPRETS. No wrapper is at fault, so no mirror-the-wrapper
// remedy applies. These three members are the same fork, the same three Go lines, and the same
// measured consumer (os/user).
//
// ⚠ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL, when the twin was cured on 2026-08: the cure was applied to the
// package whose suite reached it. `internal/syscall/windows` declares its OWN TOKEN_GROUPS,
// SID_AND_ATTRIBUTES and SID_IDENTIFIER_AUTHORITY and its OWN getTokenInfo loop, and nothing
// reached them until Go 1.24 moved os/user's group lookup onto the process token. The class was
// closed; this package's copy of it was not.
//
// WHAT WAS MEASURED HERE (i9, c5f7b4b90d and ad7795475a, at 4586b299a0):
//
//   AllGroups           `slice bounds out of range [::20] with capacity 14`. The token reports 20
//                       groups; the alias over the length-1 managed array reads 14. os/user
//                       TestGroupIds, on the 1.24 process-token path
//   GetSidIdentifierAuthority
//                       `Fatal error. System.AccessViolationException` at go.array<byte>.Clone(),
//                       through os/user isServiceAccount <- lookupUsernameAndDomain <-
//                       newUserFromSid.
//                       A process kill that ended the test host and left 494 leaves with no C# side
//
// ONE ROOT, ONE LINE APART. Both begin at security_windows.cs:201's `(ж<TOKEN_GROUPS>)(uintptr)(i)`
// and its sibling at :236 --- a kernel-filled byte buffer CAST to a managed record whose field is a
// MANAGED REFERENCE, so the first read of that field fabricates an object reference out of raw
// kernel bytes. AllGroups then reads the fabricated array's length (14) instead of the buffer's
// entries (20); GetSidIdentifierAuthority dereferences the fabrication immediately and dies. The
// alias in AllGroups is not the defect and a bigger alias would not fix it.
//
// THE REMEDY IS THE TWIN'S, PORTED, and its two halves are stated there rather than here:
//
//  1. TYPE. The machine words ARE valid PSIDs --- the layout is right and only the type is
//     wrong --- so they are read as what they are, through a [StructLayout(Sequential)] mirror,
//     and wrapped as
//     NATIVE boxes over those addresses. `syscall.SID` is Go's `struct{}`, an opaque handle managed
//     code never reads through, so a native box is not merely safe but exactly right.
//  2. LIFETIME. Windows appends the SID bytes INSIDE the buffer it filled and the Sid fields point
//     AT THEM, so the payload is self-referential and the addresses are meaningful only while the
//     buffer stays put. The buffer is therefore allocated on the PINNED OBJECT HEAP and anchored to
//     each SID that names it by a ConditionalWeakTable --- alive and still-at-that-address become
//     the same statement, and the buffer is collected exactly when Go's own would be.
//
// ⚠ AND WHY NOT COPY THE SIDs OUT, which is the reading the word "transcribe" invites: copying
// needs each SID's LENGTH, and the only way to ask is GetLengthSid --- a kernel call THROUGH the
// very address whose validity is the question. The twin's header settles it in one sentence and
// this file
// follows it: pin the buffer, do not copy. `SID_IDENTIFIER_AUTHORITY` is the one member that IS
// copied, and for the opposite reason --- it is six plain bytes with nothing self-referential in
// them, and Go returns it BY VALUE.
//
// WHAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE TWIN, stated because the twin's file cannot be read as covering it:
// TOKEN_USER holds ONE SIDAndAttributes, TOKEN_GROUPS holds GroupCount of them in a VARIABLE-LENGTH
// trailing array. So GetTokenGroups sizes the managed `Groups` to GroupCount and transcribes every
// entry --- after which AllGroups needs no address at all, and becomes a plain managed slice over a
// correctly sized array. That is the whole of AllGroups' repair: the defect was upstream of it.
