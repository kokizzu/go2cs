The weak package is a package for managing weak pointers.

Weak pointers are pointers that explicitly do not keep a value live and
must be queried for a regular Go pointer.
The result of such a query may be observed as nil at any point after a
weakly-pointed-to object becomes eligible for reclamation by the garbage
collector.
More specifically, weak pointers become nil as soon as the garbage collector
identifies that the object is unreachable, before it is made reachable
again by a finalizer.
In terms of the C# language, these semantics are roughly equivalent to the
the semantics of "short" weak references.
In terms of the Java language, these semantics are roughly equivalent to the
semantics of the WeakReference type.

Using go:linkname to access this package and the functions it references
is explicitly forbidden by the toolchain because the semantics of this
package have not gone through the proposal process. By exposing this
functionality, we risk locking in the existing semantics due to Hyrum's Law.

If you believe you have a good use-case for weak references not already
covered by the standard library, file a proposal issue at
https://github.com/golang/go/issues instead of relying on this package.

// go2cs NATIVE IMPLEMENTATION (hand-owned; replaces the converted pointer.go output). This package's
// whole body is two //go:linkname declarations, and both push bodies live in runtime/mheap.go:
// `registerWeakPointer` → `getOrAddWeakHandle` → `getWeakHandle` → `spanOfHeap`, and
// `makeStrongFromWeak`, which loads a word out of a heap-allocated handle and RE-DERIVES an object
// pointer from that address after sweeping the span it lands in. Both read `mheap_` span metadata the
// managed model does not populate, and the second asks a question — "what object lives at this
// address?" — that the CLR does not answer at all. The converted forms therefore could only fault or,
// far worse, hand back a plausible-looking pointer derived from garbage, so the linkname pair is
// registered UNHONORABLE and announces itself by name (see linknamePushTargets in the converter). This
// file is what those announcements were pointing at.
//
// The remedy is the sync.Mutex / internal/concurrent.HashTrieMap precedent (mutex.cs, hashtriemap.cs):
// runtime-coupled machinery gets a managed-native rewrite that keeps the Go API and its OBSERVABLE
// contract while dropping the mechanism. That is a better fit here than anywhere it has been applied
// so far, because the CLR has first-class weak references of its own and the contract translates
// clause for clause:
//
//   Go's contract                                   | Managed mechanism
//   ------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------
//   Make(ptr) never fails; Strong() yields the       | WeakReference<ж<T>> over the ж<T> box, SHORT
//   ORIGINAL pointer while the referent is reachable | (trackResurrection: false — Go's weak handle
//   and nil once the collector has identified it as  | likewise clears BEFORE a finalizer can make the
//   unreachable, BEFORE a finalizer resurrects it    | object reachable again)
//   A weak pointer does not keep its referent alive  | Nothing on the Pointer<T> → handle → referent
//                                                   | path is a strong reference (see below)
//   Weak handles are UNIQUE AND CANONICAL for each   | A ConditionalWeakTable keyed on the referent
//   byte offset into an object, so two weak pointers | ALLOCATION, whose value is a dictionary keyed
//   made from pointers that compare equal compare    | on the Go POINTER — ж<T>'s own Equals/GetHashCode
//   equal — and pointers to different offsets in one | are exactly Go's pointer identity, including
//   object do NOT                                   | "different fields of one struct are different
//                                                   | addresses". Pointer<T> then compares by handle
//                                                   | REFERENCE, as Go compares the handle address
//   Equality is retained after the referent is       | Pointer<T> holds the handle STRONGLY, so the
//   reclaimed                                        | handle outlives the referent and keeps
//                                                   | answering; it just answers nil forever after
//   A weak pointer created after a resurrection is   | The table entry dies WITH the referent (that is
//   NEWLY UNIQUE, never equal to one made before     | what a ConditionalWeakTable key is), so a later
//                                                   | Make mints a fresh handle
//
// WHY THE CANONICAL TABLE DOES NOT PIN WHAT IT INDEXES — the one subtle claim in this file. The table
// is a ConditionalWeakTable, i.e. an EPHEMERON: its value (and everything the value strongly
// references) is kept alive only while the KEY is independently reachable, and references FROM the
// value TO the key do not count as reachability. So:
//
//   - The key is the referent allocation (ж<T>.ReferentObject — the same lifetime question
//     runtime.SetFinalizer already keys on in mfinal.cs, and answered the same way: an element ref
//     resolves to its backing storage, a field ref to the containing allocation, and a standard heap
//     box to ITSELF, the box being the allocation).
//   - The value holds the ж<T> boxes strongly, as dictionary keys. That is deliberate: for a FIELD or
//     ELEMENT pointer the box is a per-expression view that would otherwise die long before the
//     struct does, and Strong() must keep returning it. The ephemeron makes that safe — the view
//     strong-references the source, but a value→key edge roots nothing.
//   - The handle holds ONLY a WeakReference. Pointer<T> is reachable from wherever the program puts
//     it (unique's intern map, for one), so any strong edge from the handle to the referent would
//     make weak.Pointer keep its value alive — the precise inverse of the package's purpose.
//
// Composing those three, a box is reachable exactly when its referent is, so the plain WeakReference
// tracks the REFERENT's liveness for every pointer shape, not merely the standard-box shape.
//
// ONE SHAPE IS NOT MODELLED, and it is Go's error case too: a box that ALIASES A NATIVE ADDRESS
// (golib's fourth ж kind) names unmanaged storage the collector does not own, so its managed
// reachability is not the Go question. Go answers this by faulting —
// `throw("getWeakHandle on invalid pointer")`, since a non-heap address has no span. Nothing in the
// converted corpus takes a weak pointer to one; if something ever does, it observes an eventual nil
// rather than a fabricated pointer, which is the safe direction.
//
// ⚠ Pointer<T> is written out rather than left to [GoType], and the reason is a defect this hand-own
// also closes. The generated struct equality is field-wise `==` GUARDED on every type parameter
// carrying an IEqualityOperators constraint, and Go's `Pointer[T any]` carries none — so the emitted
// body was literally `Equals(other) => false /* missing equality constraints */`. Two weak pointers to
// the same object NEVER compared equal, which silently defeats unique.Make's
// `m.CompareAndDelete(value, wp)` (it could never match, so a dead entry could never be evicted) and
// contradicts the type's own doc comment above. Equality is the whole reason the runtime canonicalizes
// the handle, so it is hand-written here — and as IEquatable<Pointer<T>>, which the generated form does
// not implement, so EqualityComparer<Pointer<T>>.Default reaches it without boxing on every lookup.

// internal.weak.csproj, package_info.cs and README.md as well (the position internal/godebug and
