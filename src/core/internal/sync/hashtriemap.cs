// go2cs NATIVE IMPLEMENTATION (hand-owned; replaces the converted hashtriemap.go output). Go's
// HashTrieMap is a lock-free hash-trie seeded entirely from one runtime descriptor read: initSlow
// takes `abi.TypeOf(m).MapType().Hasher` — a raw function pointer into the hashing machinery the
// compiler emits for `map[K]V` — together with `Elem.Equal`, its matching bit-compare thunk. Both
// take unsafe.Pointers and mean "hash / compare the bytes AT this address".
//
// The managed reflection bridge cannot honor that contract and must not pretend to. A managed
// address names no value: two boxes holding equal strings sit at different addresses, and a pointee
// containing references moves across a GC — so an address-derived hash would stop `unique.Make(x)`
// agreeing with itself, the precise inverse of the package's purpose. Populating `Hasher` with
// something plausible-but-fake is barred by the standing rule that a descriptor field whose read
// cannot be honored must stay EMPTY: it would turn a loud construction failure into a map that is
// silently wrong. So the literal conversion compiles and can never run — the descriptor read threw
// inside the package initializer of every `unique` consumer, taking net/netip down with it.
//
// The remedy is the sync.Mutex / sync.WaitGroup precedent (mutex.cs): runtime-coupled machinery gets
// a managed-native rewrite that keeps the Go API and its concurrency contract while dropping the
// mechanism. Semantics over mechanism — nothing below is a trie. The store is a
// ConcurrentDictionary, whose guarantees line up member for member (see each method), and Go's
// keyHash/valEqual pair becomes EqualityComparer<K>/<V>.Default, which for every key shape the
// converted corpus interns IS Go's `==`:
//
//   - ж<T> — unique's own `map[*abi.Type]any` — implements IEquatable<ж<T>> as pointer IDENTITY with
//     a matching identity hash, and abi.TypeFor<T>() interns one descriptor box per System.Type, so
//     one Go type always presents one key.
//   - A [GoType] struct — net/netip's `addrDetail{isV6 bool; zoneV6 string}`, the shape unique
//     actually interns — carries a generated field-wise Equals over `==` plus a HashCode.Combine of
//     the same fields, which is Go's struct `==` exactly. It does not implement IEquatable<T>, so
//     EqualityComparer<T>.Default routes through the object override; that lands on the same
//     comparison, at the cost of a box per lookup.
//   - @string compares and hashes by CONTENT, as Go's string `==` does.
//
// ⚠ If a lookup here ever dies with EntryPointNotFoundException at IEquatable<T>.Equals, the key is
// not the type it claims to be and the defect is upstream, not in this file. The known instance:
// abi.TypeFor<T>() for an INTERFACE T returns the descriptor's `Equal` DELEGATE — Type.Elem()'s
// PtrType reinterpretation lands on the wrong member under the managed layout — and shared generics
// let that object into a ConcurrentDictionary<ж<abi.Type>, …> uncast-checked. Deliberately NOT
// defended against: tolerating a type-unsafe key is the same fake-but-plausible move the empty-Hasher
// rule forbids. The loud failure is correct; the fix belongs in internal/abi.
//
// ── Go 1.24.13 surface ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The package MOVED at 1.24 (internal/concurrent → internal/sync) and the type gained seven methods,
// lost its constructor, and widened V:
//
//   - `NewHashTrieMap` is GONE. The zero HashTrieMap is usable and `init`/`initSlow` seed it on first
//     touch, which is what `storeOf` below already did — so the constructor's departure removes a
//     member here rather than changing a design.
//   - V widened: 1.23's `HashTrieMap[K, V comparable]` became `HashTrieMap[K comparable, V any]`.
//     `valEqual` is therefore NIL for a non-comparable V, and CompareAndSwap / CompareAndDelete panic
//     UP FRONT on that — before the key is ever looked up (see mustBeStaticallyComparable). The
//     older, dynamic panic for an interface V holding a non-comparable dynamic type SURVIVES at 1.24
//     (it fires inside `valEqual`, i.e. after the key is found): BOTH panics exist, static then
//     dynamic, and both are mirrored below in that order.
//   - `keyEqual` is gone as a field; 1.24's `entry.lookup` uses K's own `==`. EqualityComparer<K>.Default
//     already was exactly that, so nothing moves.
//   - Seven methods ADDED to the managed surface: Clear, CompareAndSwap, Delete, LoadAndDelete,
//     Range, Store, Swap. All eleven public methods, and init/initSlow, take the auto's plain
//     `ж<HashTrieMap<K, V>>` receiver — the binding shape every call site already passes
//     (`Ꮡm.of(Map.Ꮡm)`, `Ꮡht.of(uniqueMap<T>.ᏑHashTrieMap)`).

    // `func(unsafe.Pointer, uintptr) uintptr { return 0 }` under the comment "Stub out the good
    // hash function with a terrible one. Everything should still work as expected." The assertion is
    // therefore not about the hash at all: it is that the map's CONTRACT survives total collision.
    //
    // That contract is honored here for real, not simulated. Installing a hook rebuilds the store
    // behind an IEqualityComparer<K> whose GetHashCode returns whatever the hook returns, leaving
    // Equals as it was — which is exactly the split Go's test makes (only keyHash is replaced;
    // valEqual stays the map's own). Every key then lands in one bucket and correctness rests
    // entirely on equality and on the store's own concurrency guarantees, which is the state Go's
    // badly-hashed trie is in and the state the nine subtests measure.
    //
    // ⚠ Only ONE of the hook's two inputs can be honored, and the other is passed as the NIL pointer

    // ignores the address — the only kind that can be honored, and the kind Go's test writes — gets
    // its exact answer. A hook that dereferences it faults loudly, which is the correct outcome under
    // the same rule that keeps the descriptor's Hasher empty: a loud failure beats a silent lie.
    //
    // Note what this does NOT claim. Because the address is unavailable, every honorable hook is a
    // function of the seed alone, i.e. constant across keys — so honoring a hook and forcing total
    // collision are the same act here. Nothing is lost by that: no hook this implementation could

// nothing, so EqualityComparer<valueCell<V>>.Default IS reference equality, which is reflexive for
