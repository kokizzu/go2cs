// go2cs HAND-OWNED (whole-file replacement of the converted fd_writev_unix.go output) -- the
// STRUCT-PASSING seam for writev's iovec ARRAY, on the LINUX flavor.
//
// The converted body handed the kernel the address of a managed `slice<Iovec>`:
//
//     var ᴋ0 = Ꮡ(iovecs, 0);
//     (r, _, e) = syscall.Syscall(SYS_WRITEV, fd, (uintptr)ᴋ0, len(iovecs));
//
// `Iovec.Base` is a `ж<byte>` -- an OBJECT REFERENCE -- so the struct is non-blittable, the CLR
// gives it AUTO layout, and the kernel reads 16 bytes per element that are neither `{void*;
// size_t}` nor in that field order. It is the same class as Timezoneinformation (windows) and
// Msghdr (this flavor, sockaddr_linux_impl.cs), and its signature is diagnostic: the RIGHT COUNT
// of iovecs with GARBAGE contents. G measured it on the net row as ten 0x38s arriving where
// 0x00..0x09 were sent as ten one-byte iovecs -- wrong bytes, never a short write.
//
// The layout now lives behind syscall's GoWritevNative, which builds the blittable NativeIovec
// image already declared for the msghdr family and PINS each base rather than marshalling it (see
// that helper's comment for why `(uintptr)` on the box is the pin as well as the address). Only
// the layout moved: Go's EINTR retry loop stays here, where Go has it.
//
// Marked so a -stdlib reconvert cannot emit the Go version over it.
