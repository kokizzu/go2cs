Package heap provides heap operations for any type that implements heap.Interface. A heap is a tree with the property that each node is the minimum-valued node in its subtree.

The minimum element in the tree is the root, at index 0.

A heap is a common way to implement a priority queue. To build a priority queue, implement the Heap interface with the (negative) priority as the ordering for the Less method, so Push adds items while Pop removes the highest-priority item from the queue. The Examples include such an implementation; the file example\_pq\_test.go has the complete source.
