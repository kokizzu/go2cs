// go2cs NATIVE IMPLEMENTATION (hand-owned; replaces the converted pool.go output — a member of the
// native sync family alongside Mutex/RWMutex/WaitGroup, the runtime hooks in runtime_impl.cs, and the
// poolDequeue slot fork in poolqueue.cs). Go's Pool is a per-P sharded cache co-designed with the
// scheduler: procPin pins the goroutine to a P, the P's id indexes a [P]poolLocal block reached by
// POINTER ARITHMETIC through an unsafe.Pointer (indexLocal), and the GC drives the victim-cache aging.
// Converted literally that is raw metal on a managed referent — the block is a managed array, so the
// pointer arithmetic has no meaning here — and the pin, which is what gives each shard's dequeue its
// single producer, has nothing to pin to.
//
// So the whole type is reimplemented on managed primitives, keeping every piece of Go's ALGORITHM
// (private slot, then the shard's shared chain, then stealing from other shards, then the victim
// cache; poolCleanup ages local → victim → dropped) and replacing only the three pieces that cannot
// exist here:
//
//   - The [P]poolLocal block becomes a poolLocal[] held directly (poolState), so a shard is an object
//     reference instead of an offset. The cache-line pad Go adds against false sharing has no managed
//     expression — each shard is separately allocated — so it is gone.
//   - The P pin becomes a THREAD-affine shard index (runtime_procPin in runtime_impl.cs). Threads
//     outnumber shards, so two threads can share one shard, which a real pin rules out; this file
//     closes that gap where it matters: the private slot is taken and filled with a single interlocked
//     step, and the shard's shared-chain HEAD — single-producer by poolqueue.go's contract — is
//     serialized by a per-shard producer gate. Stealing (popTail) stays lock-free, as designed.
//   - poolCleanup is registered with the runtime exactly as Go registers it, and runs when a garbage
//     collection is REQUESTED (runtime.GC() → the pool hook; see runtime's managed_impl.cs) rather
//     than at the start of every cycle including automatic ones. Two honest consequences: a program
//     that never calls runtime.GC() holds its cached items longer than Go's would (a retention
//     divergence, not a correctness one — Pool only promises that items MAY vanish), and the cleanup
//     runs on the caller's thread instead of with the world stopped, so a Put racing it can land in a
//     shard that just became a victim and age one cycle early. Pool's contract permits exactly that.
