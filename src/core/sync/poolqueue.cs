// go2cs NATIVE FORK (hand-owned; replaces the converted poolqueue.go output). The fork is confined to
// poolDequeue's SLOT REPRESENTATION — the packed head/tail, the fullness test, the CAS protocol and
// the whole poolChain half below are Go's, unchanged.
//
// Go's poolDequeue is a lock-free ring of `eface` slots — the raw two-word {type, value} form of an
// `any` — and its entire ownership protocol hangs on the TYPE word: a slot is empty iff typ == nil,
// and a consumer publishes "I am done with this slot" by atomically storing nil into typ alone. That
// is raw-metal on a MANAGED referent. An `any` under the CLR is ONE reference, so the literal
// conversion reinterprets the two-word struct as an `any` and the typ word ends up doing double duty
// as both the type tag and the value. Two failures follow at once: a slot read back through the
// reinterpretation surfaces the type word as the value ("panic: interface conversion: interface {} is
// unsafe.Pointer, not int"), and the empty-slot sentinel — a nil unsafe.Pointer — is indistinguishable
// from a stored value of that type, so pushHead and popTail disagree about who owns a slot and the
// ring corrupts or wedges. TestPoolChain/TestPoolDequeue crashed the test host on it.
//
// The fork follows the ruled precedent (sync's Mutex/notifyList; src/Archived/Baseline-vs-FullConversion.md,
// "Hand-owning a package to make it OPERATIONAL"): reimplement the SEMANTIC on managed primitives,
// never emulate the mechanism. A slot becomes one managed reference — which is exactly what an `any`
// is here — and null is the empty-slot sentinel, a state no stored value can forge. That also
// collapses Go's two-step release (write the value word, then publish by storing nil into the type
// word) into a single Volatile.Write of null: with one word there is nothing to tear, so that one
// write both clears the value and hands the slot back to the producer.
