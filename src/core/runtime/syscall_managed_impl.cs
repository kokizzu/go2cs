// The entersyscall FAMILY -- entersyscall, reentersyscall, entersyscallblock, exitsyscall --
// hand-owned (COORD ruling 2026-09-22; registered in manualConversionFuncs["runtime"]).
//
// WHY. Go's family hands the goroutine's P to the scheduler for the length of a system call and
// records the caller's PC/SP/FP (gp.syscallpc / syscallsp / syscallbp) for tracebacks taken while
// it is blocked. The managed host has no P to release and no M to hand off -- every goroutine is a
// dedicated thread (golib's executor) -- and a traceback over a managed syscall reads no Go PC, so
// those three fields stay ZERO. entersyscall's own first line,
// `reentersyscall(sys.GetCallerPC(), sys.GetCallerSP(), getcallerfp())`, reads two compiler
// intrinsics whose contract cannot be met here; they STAY THROWING by name (a synthetic PC would
// feed Go's PC arithmetic), which is why the family is displaced rather than the intrinsics given
// a value. Left converted, the runtime row's test host died on the first runtime.Entersyscall of
// TestPreemptionAfterSyscall's goroutines.
//
// WHAT MOVES: only the goroutine's status, _Grunning -> _Gsyscall on entry and back on exit, so a
// reader of gp's status (the goroutine profile, readgstatus) sees the truth. The CAS is made
// directly on atomicstatus rather than through casgstatus, for the reason stubs_impl.cs's park hook
// records: casgstatus's tracked arm into _Grunning records sched.timeToRun, whose inline histogram is
// unallocated in the managed zero-value `sched`. An entry from any status but _Grunning, or an exit
// from any status but _Gsyscall, is a caller defect and throws by name, as the park hook does.
//
// Hand-owned: there is no syscall_managed_impl.go, so a -stdlib reconvert never regenerates this file.
