// runtime.usleep on Windows, hand-owned (COORD ruling 2026-09-22; manualConversionFuncs["runtime"],
// goosWindows).
//
// WHY. Go's Windows usleep runs on the system stack and waits `us` microseconds on the M's
// high-resolution waitable timer (SetWaitableTimer + WaitForSingleObject), or ms-grained on
// WaitForSingleObject(INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE, us/1000) when there is none -- both through
// stdcall6/stdcall2 -> asmcgocall, which has no managed body. Left converted, every usleep threw
// NotImplementedException: the runtime row's test host died on one inside
// TestRuntimeLockMetricsAndProfile/runtime.lock/sample-1's contention loop.
//
// WHAT. The same wait, without the OS call: the whole milliseconds through Thread.Sleep (the
// scheduler-friendly grain), then the sub-millisecond remainder by yielding against a
// Stopwatch deadline, so a usleep(100) waits ~100 µs rather than a rounded 0 or 1 ms. usleep(0)
// returns at once, as a zero-length wait does. The caller's goroutine is a dedicated thread (golib's
// executor), so blocking it is exactly what Go's M does, and systemstack collapses to a direct call.
