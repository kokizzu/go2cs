// runtime_expandFinalInlineFrame — the linkname destination runtime/symtab.go pushes into
// runtime/pprof, standing in for a push this corpus does not perform.
//
// WHY IT NEEDED A BODY AT ALL
//   Every linkname destination declared in this package is a bodyless partial (runtime.cs's five,
//   pprof.cs's eight), so PartialStubGenerator gives each one a throwing stub and nothing forwards.
//   That is tolerable for a function nothing calls. This is not one: appendLocsForStack calls it on
//   the FIRST line of every stack it encodes (proto.cs:396), so the stub takes down every test that
//   builds a profile at all — reported as `infrastructure-error`, which is not even a verdict.
//
// WHY `return stk` IS GO'S OWN ANSWER AND NOT AN APPROXIMATION
//   Read runtime's implementation (symtab.cs) and it has three early returns before it expands
//   anything:
//
//       if len(stk) == 0            -> return stk
//       f := findfunc(tracepc); if !f.valid()  -> return stk   // "Not a Go function."
//       if !u.isInlined(uf)         -> return stk   // "Nothing inline at tracepc."
//
//   In this corpus the SECOND one fires for every pc that will ever be passed. findfunc walks the
//   module list and skips any module whose pclntable is empty (symtab.cs:268); the only moduledata
//   here is a permanent empty stub, so the search cannot succeed and f is never valid. Running
//   runtime's code would therefore return stk — this body returns the same value by the same
//   reasoning, without depending on a cross-assembly `internal` it cannot reach.
//
// AND IT STAYS RIGHT WHEN THE REGISTRY'S READ-BACK LANDS — which is the reason it is a LOCAL body
// rather than a forward. Once findfunc resolves synthetic PCs, forwarding would become actively
// dangerous: f would validate, and runtime's code would walk on to newInlineUnwinder to read an
// inline tree that does not exist. A synthetic PC has none BY CONSTRUCTION — the registry answers
// "which function", never "which instruction", and DESIGN-synthetic-pc-registry.md §8 refuses
// inlining trees explicitly — so "nothing inline at tracepc" is permanently true for every pc this
// package can hand us, real or synthetic. The third early return is the one that would fire then,
// and it returns stk as well.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM
//   Not that inline expansion works. It does not, and cannot without a pclntab. A profile built
//   here attributes a sample to the physical frame rather than to the inlined callers Go would
//   name — a fidelity limit, stated here so it is not rediscovered as a defect.
