// Pointer is a weak pointer to a value of type T.
//
// Just like regular pointers, Pointer may reference any part of an
// object, such as a field of a struct or an element of an array.
// Objects that are only pointed to by weak pointers are not considered
// reachable, and once the object becomes unreachable, [Pointer.Value]
// may return nil.
//
// The primary use-cases for weak pointers are for implementing caches,
// canonicalization maps (like the unique package), and for tying together
// the lifetimes of separate values (for example, through a map with weak
// keys).
//
// Two Pointer values always compare equal if the pointers from which they were
// created compare equal. This property is retained even after the
// object referenced by the pointer used to create a weak reference is
// reclaimed.
// If multiple weak pointers are made to different offsets within the same object
// (for example, pointers to different fields of the same struct), those pointers
// will not compare equal.
// If a weak pointer is created from an object that becomes unreachable, but is
// then resurrected due to a finalizer, that weak pointer will not compare equal
// with weak pointers created after the resurrection.
//
// Calling [Make] with a nil pointer returns a weak pointer whose [Pointer.Value]
// always returns nil. The zero value of a Pointer behaves as if it were created
// by passing nil to [Make] and compares equal with such pointers.
//
// [Pointer.Value] is not guaranteed to eventually return nil.
// [Pointer.Value] may return nil as soon as the object becomes
// unreachable.
// Values stored in global variables, or that can be found by tracing
// pointers from a global variable, are reachable. A function argument or
// receiver may become unreachable at the last point where the function
// mentions it. To ensure [Pointer.Value] does not return nil,
// pass a pointer to the object to the [runtime.KeepAlive] function after
// the last point where the object must remain reachable.
//
// Note that because [Pointer.Value] is not guaranteed to eventually return
// nil, even after an object is no longer referenced, the runtime is allowed to
// perform a space-saving optimization that batches objects together in a single
// allocation slot. The weak pointer for an unreferenced object in such an
// allocation may never become nil if it always exists in the same batch as a
// referenced object. Typically, this batching only happens for tiny
// (on the order of 16 bytes or less) and pointer-free objects.
