// RUNTIME DELEGATE SYNTHESIS — the second place golib mints a CLR type, and the last one the
// reflection bridge needs.
//
// WHY THERE IS A FILE HERE AT ALL
//   A Go func value IS a managed delegate, so `reflect.FuncOf` COMPOSES a delegate type where Go
//   assembles a funcType record (GoReflect.MakeGoFuncType, TryFuncShape's exact inverse). Composing
//   means NAMING a declared delegate family, and every family is finite: System.Func/Action stop at
//   16 parameters, golib's own ladder continues them to 24 (funcArity.cs), and the variadic families
//   carry 8 fixed parameters ahead of the `params Span<T>` tail (variadic.cs). Go's own limit is 128
//   (`reflect.FuncOf: too many arguments`) and its reflect suite drives past every one of those
//   ceilings — all_test.go's TestFuncOf builds a 51-parameter func for issue #54669. Past the
//   declared rungs there is no type to name, so one is minted: the same answer, and the same
//   mechanism, GoStructSynthesis gives `reflect.StructOf`.
//
// THE POINT IS THAT NOTHING DOWNSTREAM CHANGES
//   A minted delegate is described by TryFuncShape, GoTypeName, KindOf and the Value machinery
//   exactly as a declared one is, because not one of them asks where a System.Type came from. The
//   round trip IS the contract — NumIn/In/NumOut/Out/IsVariadic unchanged through
//   MakeGoFuncType → TryFuncShape — and it is guarded rather than argued
//   (GolibTests.DelegateArityMintTests).
//
// MINTED ONLY AS THE RESIDUAL — DECLARED-FIRST IS A CONTRACT, NOT A PREFERENCE
//   Go INTERNS func types: `FuncOf(in, out, variadic) == TypeOf(f)` for a matching declared f, which
//   is precisely what TestFuncOf's checkSameType asserts. A converted `func(T1) string` IS
//   `Func<T1, @string>`, so answering FuncOf with a freshly minted type of that shape would be a
//   DIFFERENT System.Type and the identity would fail. GoReflect.MakeDelegateType therefore routes
//   to the declared family wherever one exists and reaches this file only past every ceiling — where
//   the two domains cannot overlap, since a converted package could not spell a 25-parameter func
//   type either (the ladder is what it would bind, and the ladder stops at 24).
//
// THE INTERN IS THE IDENTITY
//   Two FuncOf calls with one signature must answer ONE type, for the same reason. The intern is a
//   plain lock rather than a ConcurrentDictionary factory ON PURPOSE, GoStructSynthesis's reason
//   exactly: GetOrAdd runs its factory CONCURRENTLY on racing threads and discards the losers' work,
//   and the work here is DefineType, whose duplicate name THROWS. It is also deliberately absent
//   from ClearTypeCaches' list — a signature's minted type IS that signature's identity for the life
//   of the process, and clearing it would hand the next caller a different type for the same Go func
//   type, which is the one thing this mechanism exists to prevent.
//
// ONE ASSEMBLY, SHARED WITH THE STRUCT MINT — THE FRIEND GRANT DECIDES IT
//   A minted delegate's Invoke signature names whatever types the Go signature names, and an
//   UNEXPORTED Go type is emitted `internal`. Reaching one from a dynamic assembly needs that
//   assembly's friend grant, and every converted csproj already carries exactly one —
//   `<InternalsVisibleTo Include="go2cs.SynthesizedStructs" />`, emitted by the converter
//   (projectFileWriter.go) and by the test-project template. Minting into the SAME assembly rides
//   that grant and needs NO converter change; a separately named dynamic assembly would need a
//   second grant in every generated csproj plus a corpus-wide regen to carry it, for no gain. Type
//   identity is unaffected — identity is (assembly, name) — and the two mints cannot collide on a
//   name: `structᴛN` and `funcᴛN` come from separate counters under separate prefixes.
