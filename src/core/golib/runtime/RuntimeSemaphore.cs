/// golib rather than in a package companion because at Go 1.24 <b>TWO</b> packages declare those

/// and <c>Semrelease</c>, while the new <c>internal/sync</c> — which <c>sync.Mutex</c> now wraps
/// (<c>type Mutex struct { mu isync.Mutex }</c>) — declares <c>SemacquireMutex</c> and its own
/// <c>Semrelease</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <c>internal/sync</c> cannot call into <c>sync</c>: the corpus reference runs
/// <c>sync → internal/sync</c>, so a back-reference is a project-graph CYCLE, which
/// <c>check-solution-integrity.ps1</c> refuses per GOOS. The two companions could each hold a copy —
/// their semaphore populations are provably disjoint, since <c>internal/sync</c> declares BOTH the
/// acquire and the release half and the word lives in <c>isync.Mutex</c>, which only that package
/// touches — but a duplicate is two branches of one rule waiting to drift, which is precisely the
/// defect shape paid for elsewhere in this tree. ONE primitive, two callers.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The table is keyed by POINTER IDENTITY.</b> <see cref="ж{T}"/>'s equality is

/// </para>
/// <para>
/// ⚠ <b>Known, pre-existing, and deliberately NOT changed here:</b> the table has a
