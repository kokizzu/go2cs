/// <summary>
/// The monotonic nanosecond clock Go's <c>runtime.nanotime</c> reports — the one source every
/// converted consumer of that clock reads.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why this exists.</b> <c>runtime.nanotime1</c> is assembly in Go (a VDSO call on Linux,
/// <c>QueryPerformanceCounter</c> on Windows), so the converter emits a bodyless partial and
/// <c>PartialStubGenerator</c> fills it with a throw. That throw is not inert: <c>nanotime</c> is
/// read by <c>cpuprof</c>, <c>metrics</c>, <c>mgc</c>, <c>mgcmark</c>, <c>mgcpacer</c>,
/// <c>mprof</c>, <c>netpoll</c> and <c>debuglog</c>, so the first call into any of them dies —
/// <c>runtime/pprof</c>'s <c>StartCPUProfile</c> reaches it through
/// <c>SetCPUProfileRate</c> and takes the host down with a goroutine panic.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why it is truthful rather than a stand-in.</b> Go's contract for this clock is narrow and
/// entirely satisfiable here: a monotonic, nanosecond-denominated counter whose EPOCH IS
/// ARBITRARY, because only differences are ever observed. <see cref="Stopwatch"/> is the same
/// underlying source Go uses on Windows (<c>QueryPerformanceCounter</c>), so this is the platform's
/// own monotonic clock rather than a model of one.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The scaling is the part that has to be right.</b> Ticks are scaled to nanoseconds with a
/// seconds/remainder split rather than the obvious <c>ticks * 1e9 / Frequency</c>: that product
/// overflows <see cref="long"/> for any real uptime (at a 10 MHz timer it passes
/// <c>long.MaxValue</c> in about 15 minutes), which would make the clock jump BACKWARDS — the one
/// property a monotonic clock may never lose. Splitting keeps <c>seconds * 1e9</c> and
/// <c>rem * 1e9 / Frequency</c> (with <c>rem &lt; Frequency</c>) each well inside range while
/// preserving full sub-tick resolution.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This is deliberately the same computation <c>time</c>'s hand-owned <c>runtimeNano</c> already
/// performs, because the two must agree: a converted program can compare a <c>time.Since</c>
/// against a runtime-sourced duration, and two independently-derived "monotonic" clocks would make
/// that comparison meaningless. Stated here rather than shared by reference because <c>time</c>
/// sits above <c>runtime</c> and cannot be depended on from below; if the two ever diverge, this
/// remark is the record that they were meant to be one clock.

    /// <c>ticks.init</c>. That initializer is called from <c>schedinit</c>, which this corpus never
    /// reaches, so <c>startTicks</c> and <c>startTime</c> are both zero and the expression collapses
