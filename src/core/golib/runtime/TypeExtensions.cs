/// <summary>
/// Runtime answers to questions asked of a <see cref="Type"/> that the C# type system settles at
/// compile time but converted Go code has to settle at run time.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// This primary file holds the questions a single <see cref="Type"/> can answer ALONE: which
/// operators it declares, whether it nominally implements an interface, and whether it is a
/// converted <c>dyn</c> type. Everything here is memoized per type, because each answer is an
/// immutable fact about the type while READING it is a reflection lookup that allocates.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The class is <c>partial</c> because the rest of it is three concerns that share nothing but the
/// name of this class, and burying any one inside the others is what made the single file hard to
/// read. Each sibling carries a banner explaining itself:
/// </para>
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><c>TypeExtensions.ExtensionMethodRegistry.cs</c> — the process-wide scan that discovers
/// converted Go methods (emitted as C# extension methods) and makes them callable.</item>
/// <item><c>TypeExtensions.GoMethodSets.cs</c> — Go's value-vs-pointer receiver rule and the
/// structural interface-satisfaction probe built on it.</item>
/// <item><c>TypeExtensions.NumericConversions.cs</c> — boxed scalar to Go scalar conversions.</item>
/// </list>
/// <para>
/// The one cross-file coupling to know about: the registry's assembly-load hook clears caches
/// declared in the method-sets file, because both are derived from the same scan. Its banner
/// spells out the rule for adding another.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <see cref="ImplementsInterface"/> stays HERE, next to the operator lookups, rather than with the
/// method sets — and the contrast is worth keeping in view. It is the NOMINAL test: does this CLR
/// type declare that interface, directly or through a base. Go's test is structural, and that one
/// lives in the method-sets file. A type can pass one and fail the other in both directions.
