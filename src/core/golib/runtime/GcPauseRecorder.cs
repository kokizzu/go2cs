/// The per-GC-cycle pause history behind <c>runtime.ReadMemStats</c> and

/// Design: <c>docs/phase4/DESIGN-readmemstats-surface.md</c> (RATIFIED 2026-08-21, all six open
/// questions ruled as recommended; §7.1 carries the S0/S1 measurements this implementation is built
/// on). §2 is the one definition everything below follows from: <b>a Go GC cycle is a CLR gen2
/// collection</b>. Go has one heap generation, so every Go cycle is a full cycle; the CLR has three,
/// and <c>NumGC</c> had already chosen gen2 (<c>GC.CollectionCount(GC.MaxGeneration)</c>). Applying
/// that identity uniformly makes the ring a gen2 ring, <c>LastGC</c> a gen2 end time, and
/// <c>PauseTotalNs</c> the ring's gen2 running sum (⟨OQ-5⟩).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The mechanism (§3.1, §3.2) — a resurrecting finalizable sentinel.</b> <see cref="Sentinel"/> is
/// an object nothing strongly references; its finalizer calls <see cref="Observe"/> and then
/// <c>GC.ReRegisterForFinalize(this)</c>, so it wakes once per collection that condemns its
/// generation — which, after its first promotion, is gen2. The alternatives were priced and refused:
/// <c>GC.RegisterForFullGCNotification</c> requires background GC to be turned OFF process-wide, an
/// in-process EventPipe listener receives runtime events ~117 ms after the fact (r56d), and polling
/// <c>GetGCMemoryInfo</c> from each read loses every collection between two reads — which puts holes
/// in a ring whose slots are indexed by cycle number.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Write ordering is Go's, verbatim.</b> <see cref="Observe"/> writes
/// <c>pauseNs[observed % 256]</c> and then increments <c>observed</c>, exactly as
/// <c>gcMarkTermination</c> writes <c>pause_ns[numgc%256]</c> before incrementing <c>numgc</c>. That
/// is what makes <c>MemStats</c>' documented "the most recent pause is at
/// <c>PauseNs[(NumGC+255)%256]</c>" true by construction, and what makes <c>ReadGCStats</c>' backwards
/// walk line up with it by construction rather than by agreement.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b><c>NumGC</c> is <see cref="Observed"/>, not <c>CollectionCount</c>.</b> Both surfaces read one
/// snapshot taken under one lock, so there is no second source to disagree with. The cost is that
/// <c>NumGC</c> can lag the true gen2 count by at most one collection, for at most the finalizer's
/// scheduling latency — and understating is the safe direction, because a pause the recorder did not
/// observe is never invented. <see cref="Drain"/> closes the lag at the one boundary Go's tests
/// depend on: <c>runtime.GC()</c> and <c>debug.FreeOSMemory()</c> both drain before returning.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Measured boundaries (§7.1.5, i7-5820K, .NET 9.0.19).</b> The lag bound holds exactly in both

/// and naturally paced (54 collections in 4.0 s, all 54 observed). It degrades only under gen2
/// collections forced BACK TO BACK with no drain between them, where the finalizer thread never gets
/// a turn and <see cref="Observe"/> advances by at most one per call (17.8–25.6 % observed). That is a
/// harness pattern, and the one harness pattern that matters — <c>runtime.GC()</c> in a loop — is
/// drained by construction. The negative control holds too: a strongly-referenced sentinel is never
/// finalized, so the live readings are evidence of the resurrection and not of some other wake-up.

/// two rejected activation models are rejected on correctness, not cost: arming on first read would
