/// <summary>
/// The adaptive escalation behind <c>runtime.Gosched</c> (board finding 2026-08-21, ratified):
/// consecutive provably-inert yields escalate to <see cref="Thread.Sleep(int)"/> so a starved
/// peer thread can reach the processor.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Converted goroutines are dedicated OS threads, so a bare <see cref="Thread.Yield"/> rotates the
/// KERNEL's run queue rather than Go's own. Linux lowers it to sched_yield(2), which CFS makes
/// near-inert for CPU-bound threads: sync/atomic's TestValueCompareAndSwapConcurrent — a strict
/// token-passing ring whose every handoff needs one specific thread scheduled — exceeded 45 minutes
/// on Linux against 183 s on Windows on the same silicon. Sleeping leaves the run queue entirely,
/// which is what actually lets the one thread that can make progress run.
///
/// Inertness is decided by TIMING, not by <see cref="Thread.Yield"/>'s return value alone, because
/// that value lies on Linux (measured 2026-08-21, both hosts, 12 logical processors: Windows idle
/// yields return false at ~300 ns and contended return true at ~4.1 µs; Linux returns true in both
/// states, ~431 ns idle vs ~6.5 µs contended). A 2 µs threshold sits in that gap with ≥7× margin
/// on each side, on each host: an inert yield is <c>!switched || elapsed &lt; 2 µs</c>.
///
/// The counter is per-thread (one goroutine per thread makes that per-goroutine) and resets on any
/// effective yield or escalation. There is deliberately NO time-spaced reset: a thread whose
/// sporadic Gosched calls are all inert accrues one 1 ms sleep per 64 such calls, a negligible cost
/// for sporadic use, and the clock reads a reset rule would add are the fast path this class must
/// not tax.
///
/// THE 1 ms IS 1 ms ON WINDOWS TOO (i9, 2026-09-26, COORD ruling after 03df2f43aa). On Windows 11,
/// <see cref="Thread.Sleep(int)"/> runs at the PROCESS's timer resolution, and a process that never
/// asked for a finer one sleeps a whole tick: Sleep(1) measured in-process at p50 15.75 ms / p99 16.49
/// ms while NtQueryTimerResolution reported 1 ms machine-wide. A lone yielder is inert on every call,
/// so it paid ~15.7 ms per 64 yields, 237 s per million (Go: ~0.1 s), and runtime/pprof's
/// TestGoroutineSwitch (10 x 1M Gosched) overran its 30 m package deadline. On Windows the escalation
/// therefore waits on a high-resolution waitable timer, the object time_impl and Go's own Windows
/// runtime use for sub-tick sleeps: 1 ms measured at ~1.1-1.5 ms, 24 s per million lone yields. The
/// threshold and the sleep length are the ratified ones; only the clock that delivers them changed.
/// Linux keeps Sleep(1), which is ~1 ms there. A timer is created per escalation (a few µs against a
/// 1 ms wait) so no per-thread handle exists to classify or leak, and any failure to create or arm one
/// falls back to Sleep(1).
