// WINDOWS LONG-PATH AWARENESS - the one piece of process setup that makes a converted program
// answer a path longer than MAX_PATH the way the Go binary does.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//   Every Go Windows binary opts its own process into long-path handling at startup: osinit calls
//   initLongPathSupport (runtime/os_windows.go), which checks for Windows 10.0.15063 or later and
//   then sets the undocumented IsLongPathAwareProcess flag in the PEB's bit field. ntdll's path
//   canonicalizer consults that flag, so with it set a plain (un-prefixed) path longer than
//   MAX_PATH reaches the kernel intact.
//
//   A converted program is an ordinary .NET process, and .NET does not do this. The divergence is
//   measured, not theoretical: at a 434-character path, Go's os.Chdir succeeds where .NET's
//   Directory.SetCurrentDirectory fails with ERROR_FILENAME_EXCED_RANGE (206, 0x800700CE). That is
//   the failure that skipped syscall's TestGetwd_DoesNotPanicWhenPathIsLong, and it is a whole
//   class of Windows behavior rather than one test row.
//
// WHY NOT AN APPLICATION MANIFEST
//   longPathAware in an app manifest reaches the same PEB flag, but Windows honors it only when
//   the machine-wide policy HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem\LongPathsEnabled is
//   also 1 - so a manifested converted binary would still diverge from the Go binary on a default
//   install, where that value is 0. Go asks for neither the manifest nor the policy. Doing what Go
//   does is both the smaller change (no per-project artifact, nothing in the emitted .csproj, no
//   churn through the banked test projects) and the only one that is unconditional the way Go's is.
//
// WHY IT IS DEFENSIVE
//   This is a parity measure, not a prerequisite: everything that worked before still works with
//   the flag clear, because Go's own os.fixLongPath fallback prefixes \\?\ explicitly and the
//   converted corpus carries that fallback. So a missing export, a refused write or an unusual
//   host is swallowed rather than allowed to take down module initialization.
//
// THE OTHER HALF OF GO'S initLongPathSupport, AND WHERE IT LIVES
//   Go's initLongPathSupport also sets internal/syscall/windows.CanUseLongPaths, which makes
//   os.fixLongPath stop adding the \\?\ prefix. golib cannot set that flag itself - it is the root
//   of the dependency graph and references no converted package - so this file records the OUTCOME
//   in WindowsLongPathsEnabled and a hand-owned companion in the converted `runtime`
//   (runtime/windows/os_windows_impl.cs) copies it into runtime.canUseLongPaths, which the alias
//   makes the same variable as internal/syscall/windows.CanUseLongPaths.
//
//   This file used to propose that companion in internal/syscall/windows. `runtime` is the better
//   home on two counts: it is where Go's OWN write lives (initLongPathSupport sets
//   runtime.canUseLongPaths, and the isw copy is a //go:linkname alias of it), and it is the side
//   that keeps the C# project graph acyclic - a reference runtime -> internal/syscall/windows
//   closes six cycles through Go's own internal/syscall/windows -> syscall -> runtime. See
//   docs/phase4/DESIGN-linkname-push-cycles.md.
//
//   OUTCOME, NOT INTENT, is the whole point of exposing this as a flag rather than hardcoding true
//   on the other side. If the bit was NOT actually set - an old Windows, a refused write, an
//   unusual host, all of which this file deliberately swallows - then telling os to stop prefixing
//   would produce paths that silently fail instead of working: a plausible-looking wrong answer,
//   which is worse than the conservative divergence it replaces.
