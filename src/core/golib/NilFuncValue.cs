/// resolves it away: <see cref="GoReflect.GoDynamicTypeOf"/> answers the delegate type, the type
/// assertion (<c>builtin.TryTypeAssert</c>) succeeds against exactly that type with the null
/// delegate as the value, <see cref="GoReflect.TryMarshalAssignable"/> stores it as null, and
/// <see cref="GoReflect.IsNilGoValue"/> answers nil — so the carrier can never be stored into a
