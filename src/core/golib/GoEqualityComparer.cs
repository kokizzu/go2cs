/// comparer and compared the wrappers.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// That gap is observable because an interface value's wrapper is not stable: the same Go dynamic value
/// is presented through whichever adapter the static interface it is currently held in calls for, so
/// asserting an <c>Object</c> to a narrower <c>dependency</c> yields a DIFFERENT wrapper object over the
/// same receiver box. Under the default comparer the asserted value could no longer find its own entry
/// in the map it came out of. That is the shape <c>go/types</c>' <c>initorder.dependencyGraph</c> is
/// built on — <c>M[dependency]</c> assembled from the keys of <c>objMap[Object]</c>, then <c>objMap</c>
