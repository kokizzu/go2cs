// FUNC COOKIES — the machine word a Go func value answers when it is read AS a word.
//
// WHY THERE IS A FILE HERE AT ALL
//   Go's func value is one pointer word (to a funcval), so `uintptr(*(*unsafe.Pointer)(unsafe.Pointer(&f)))`
//   is a number an OS can carry and hand back: runtime's `nestedCall` smuggles a closure through
//   EnumTimeFormatsEx's lParam that way, and its `callback` reads it back with
//   `*(*func())(unsafe.Pointer(&lparam))` and calls it. A managed func value is a DELEGATE, a
//   reference with no address to give, so the word used to be the order token of the box HOLDING the
//   func -- which the syscall door rightly refuses as a managed-pointer token at argument 3 (runtime's
//   TestCallback family; ruling 2026-09-28 15:03 (2), approved as designed).
//
// WHAT A COOKIE PROMISES
//   Unique per delegate INSTANCE, stable while that delegate is alive, and resolvable back to it.
//   It is never an address and addresses nothing: native code only CARRIES it back, which is the
//   whole contract of an lParam. Its stated falsifier stands with the ruling -- a native callee that
//   STORES and DEREFERENCES the cookie would read nothing -- and none is known.
//
// THE BAND, and why it is disjoint from every other minted number
//   Base 0xC000_8000_0000_0000, 16 bytes per cookie: bits 63, 62 and 47 set, bits 61..48 clear.
//     - order tokens (ManagedPointerTokens.IsTaggedToken) are bit 63 set, bit 47 CLEAR: disjoint on
//       bit 47, which is exactly why the syscall door PASSES a cookie;
//     - caller spans (runtime, from 0x8000_8000_0000_0000) have bit 62 clear;
//     - synthetic PCs (GoSyntheticPC, from 0xFFFF_8000_0000_0000) have bits 61..48 set;
//     - real addresses are canonical (bits 63..47 all equal); a cookie is not.
//   Bit 63 is set, so ManagedPointerTokens.NamesNoUserMemory refuses a raw dereference of one: a
//   misuse fails as a caught nil-dereference panic, never as a read of a stranger's memory.
//
// LIFETIME, which is Go's
//   A uintptr does not keep its referent alive in Go, so the registry holds delegates WEAKLY: a
//   cookie resolves exactly while something else holds the func. nestedCall's own frame holds `f`
//   across the call, which is the liveness the ruling records.
