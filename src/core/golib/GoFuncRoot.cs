/// Represents the root execution context for all Go functions.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The panic slots below live in this thread's <see cref="GoThreadState"/>, one holder per thread, so a
/// deferring <see cref="GoFrame.Run"/> pays one thread-local lookup rather than one per slot. They were
/// five <c>ThreadLocal&lt;T&gt;</c> fields here; the meaning of each is unchanged:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>CAPTURED: the panic a frame's catch captured, shared between all frames on the thread.</item>
/// <item>HANDLED: the panic whose deferred calls are RUNNING on this thread. The captured slot is cleared
/// by recover(), but Go's traceback keeps showing the panicking frames for the rest of the deferred
/// sequence, so the panic being handled is tracked separately, strictly scoped to GoFrame.Run (saved and
/// restored), which is what keeps it from ever going stale.</item>
/// <item>UNCLAIMED: the panic a frame's own catch has just captured and that no GoFrame.Run has CLAIMED
/// yet. This is what makes the re-raise of an unrecovered panic frame-OWNED instead of thread-global:
/// GoFrame.Capture arms this slot and the very next GoFrame.Run on the thread claims it, which is always
/// that same frame's finally, because nothing runs between an emitted catch body and its finally. A frame
/// that caught nothing therefore claims null and leaves an in-flight panic alone, rather than re-raising
/// another frame's panic from the middle of that frame's deferred sequence (see GoFrame.Run).</item>
/// <item>IN-FLIGHT FOREIGN: the most recent FOREIGN (.NET, non-panic, non-Goexit) exception seen
/// unwinding through an emitted frame's IsPanic filter on this thread, preserved with its stack. It exists
/// for one consumer: GoFrame.Run's foreign-unwind correction (exec-wall design OQ-6, ratified 2026-08-22).
/// A deferred `panic(recover())` during a foreign unwind re-panics NIL, because recover() rightly sees no
/// Go panic, and without this slot that nil panic REPLACES the original defect (sync.OnceFunc/OnceValue's
/// guard is the canonical shape: every exec-wall residual behind a OnceValue-guarded probe reported
/// `panic: nil` instead of naming the NotImplementedException underneath). Overwritten by each newer
/// foreign exception, cleared when consumed and when a REAL panic is captured (GoFrame.Capture): a genuine
/// Go panic superseding the unwind is Go's own replacement rule.</item>
/// <item>RECOVERABLE: the panic the deferred sequence RUNNING on this thread may recover, Go's rule that
/// recover() succeeds only in a deferred call the panic sequence itself invoked. GoFrame.Run sets it once
/// per sequence (to the panic it is handling, or null for a normal-return sequence), updates it when a
/// deferred call's panic replaces the one being handled, and restores the outer value on exit. So a
/// recover() inside the defers of a deferred function's OWN normal return reads null, exactly as Go's
/// does (runtime's TestRecoverMatching), and the outer panic is still there for the outer sequence
/// afterwards. docs/phase4/DESIGN-recover-model.md.</item>
