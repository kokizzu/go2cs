namespace go;

// A Go NON-variadic func type used as a value lowers to a plain `Func<…>`/`Action<…>`, emitted
// UNQUALIFIED so it binds whatever delegate of that arity is in scope. The BCL family stops at
// `System.Func` with 16 parameters and `System.Action` with 16; Go has no such ceiling, so a wider
// signature named nothing at all and failed with CS0305. Go's own `reflect` test suite drives one:
// `abi_test.go`'s `callArgsManyFloat64` takes a `func` of 20 parameters returning 19 results, which
// lowers to a `Func<…>` of 21 type arguments once the results collapse into a tuple.
//
// These continue the ladder from 17 through 24 parameters, declared in `go` rather than `System`,
// and they need NO converter change to be reached: C# name lookup is ARITY-aware, so a `Func<…>`
// written inside `namespace go.<pkg>` finds a `go.Func` only at an arity `go` actually declares and
// otherwise keeps walking out to the `using System;` that supplies the BCL's. That is also why
// every arity the BCL ALREADY has is deliberately absent here — declaring one would not merely
// duplicate it, it would shadow it corpus-wide (`go` is the nearer scope) and would be an outright
// CS0104 ambiguity anywhere both namespaces are imported side by side. The shapes below are
// `System.Func`/`System.Action`'s exactly, variance included, so the two halves of one ladder are
// indistinguishable at a call site.
//
// The ceiling is 24 because that is well past what Go code plausibly writes — `reflect`'s
// deliberately-extreme ABI probe sits at 20 — and each rung costs a type nothing references. Add
// rungs when a real signature needs them, in this file, contiguously.
//
// ONE rendering is NOT covered, and it needs the converter rather than this file: a Go type ALIAS
// whose target is a func type emits its `global using` right-hand side at COMPILATION scope, where
// the delegate name is rooted EXPLICITLY as `System.Func`/`System.Action` (see `delegateRoot` in
// `typeNameResolution.go`, and the `PackageAliasRootedTypeArgs` golden). Past arity 16 that names
// nothing, and no `go.Func` can be found from there. No package in the corpus reaches it today.
