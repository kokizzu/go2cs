/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Go resolves an interface assertion structurally at run time; C# can only convert nominally. For
/// the cases the compile-time recorders cannot see — a dynamic type living in an assembly converted
/// AFTER the interface's own (io/fs is converted before os, so <c>fs/package_info.cs</c> can never
/// record <c>os.dirFS</c>) — the runtime has to BUILD an implementation. Since no dynamic code
/// generation is available, a per-interface compile-time artifact is the irreducible minimum, and it
/// must live in the interface's OWN assembly: that is the only placement guaranteed to be loaded at
/// every asserting site, and the only one that yields a single cross-assembly identity.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Discovery is by ATTRIBUTE rather than by static members on the interface itself. Static members
/// on a converted interface are inherited by every interface that embeds it, which produced both a
/// large CS0108 hiding-warning class and a method-set corruption (a Go type can never implement a
/// static helper, so an embedding interface's structural probe demanded one). Carrying the shells
/// here also makes their names non-contractual — the generator may disambiguate them freely.
