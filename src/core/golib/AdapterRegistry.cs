/// A Go type switch or type assert against a NAMED interface must match by Go METHOD-SET

/// implement the C# interface — the generated pointer adapter (<c>TжIface</c>) does — so each
/// generated adapter registers a wrapping factory here from a module initializer, and the golib
/// type-assert machinery re-wraps the box on demand. This stays reflection-free and
/// Native-AOT-safe: factories are compiled lambdas over closed generic types, and the module
/// initializer itself roots the adapter class against trimming.
/// </para>

/// The same pair can be registered by several assemblies (each assembly generates adapters for
/// its own recorded conversion sites); the first registration wins — all adapters for a pair
/// are behaviorally identical, forwarding to the same receiver methods.
