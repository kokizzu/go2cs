// THE NET-DATABASE FAMILY -- gethostbyname, getprotobyname and getservbyname -- the three unclosed
// siblings of the name-resolution arc this directory's zsyscall_windows_addrinfo_impl.cs closed.
//
// THE CLASS, stated once more only where it differs. The addrinfo twin's defect is in BOTH
// directions: hints the kernel READS and a result it WRITES. These three are read-only in one
// direction and worse for it, because the defect is in the RETURN VALUE and the generated wrapper
// spells it in a single line:
//
//     h = (ж<Hostent>)(uintptr)((@unsafe.Pointer)r0);        // zsyscall_windows.cs, _GetHostByName
//
// `r0` is ws2_32's `hostent*`. That cast reinterprets a raw native address as a MANAGED BOX over a
// record whose Name is `ж<byte>`, whose Aliases and AddrList are `ж<ж<byte>>` -- managed references
// where native `struct hostent` has raw `char*` and `char**`. Nothing faults at the cast; the
// fabrication happens at the first READ, which materializes the whole record.
//
// AND THE ONE CONSUMER READS EXACTLY ONE INTEGER, which is what makes this the row-46 shape rather
// than the addrinfo one. net's getprotobyname (net/windows/lookup_windows.cs:75) does
// `(~p).Proto` -- a uint16 -- and `~p` materializes the WHOLE Protoent on the way to it, fabricating
// Name and Aliases as managed references from ws2_32's bytes. A field that looks exempt is not; that
// is the note os/user's lookup_windows_impl.cs carries about PrimaryGroupID, in a second costume.
//
// THE LIFETIME, which is why transcription is not merely tidier here. ws2_32 returns these records
// from THREAD-LOCAL STORAGE, and net's own source says so at lookup_windows.go -- the comment
// survives conversion at lookup_windows.cs:82 ("GetProtoByName return value is stored in thread
// local storage. Start new os thread before the call to prevent races."). A managed box aliasing
// that storage is stale the moment anything else on the thread calls into the resolver. Copying on
// arrival is what makes the returned record a value the caller owns, and it removes the reason
// net's lookupProtocol has to spawn an OS thread around the call -- though it does NOT remove that
// spawn, which is upstream's code and stays as Go wrote it.
//
// THE REMEDY, the same as the twin's: blittable [StructLayout(Sequential)] mirrors, the call through
// the package's own LazyProc unchanged, and an explicit copy at the boundary into records the
// caller owns. Each transcription is exposed as its own seam so a guard can drive it from a
// hand-built image with no network, no resolver and no host database.
//
// THE FIELD ORDER IS GO'S, READ AT THE PIN, NOT RECALLED. syscall/types_windows.go declares
// Hostent {Name, Aliases, AddrType, Length, AddrList} and Protoent {Name, Aliases, Proto};
// syscall/types_windows_amd64.go declares Servent {Name, Aliases, Proto, Port} -- Proto BEFORE
// Port, which is why Servent has an arch-specific file at all. The mirrors reproduce that order,
// and their sizes are ASSERTED before use.
//
// ⚠ ALIASES AND ADDRLIST ARE THE FAITHFUL-COPY ARM, NOT A MEASURED PATH -- the same status
// copyNativeCanonname carries in the twin. No consumer in the corpus reads them today: the only
// call site is net's getprotobyname, which reads Proto alone. They are transcribed anyway, because
// the whole record is materialized by any read and a half-transcribed record is the fabrication
// this file exists to remove.
