// The STARTUPINFOW member of the syscall struct-passing class, and the one that kept syscall's
// banked row from re-banking at 1.24.13.
//
// The class, its failure mode and its remedy are documented once, in zsyscall_windows_impl.cs
// (GetTimeZoneInformation, findFirstFile1/findNextFile1, Process32First/Process32Next); that file is
// the reference and this one does not restate it. This member differs in WHAT makes the record
// reference-bearing: not an inline character array but POINTER fields. Go's StartupInfo holds
// `*uint16` (the reserved slot, Desktop, Title) and `*byte` (the second reserved slot), and each
// converts to a `ж<T>` field -- a managed reference where the native record has a raw address. So
// the converted StartupInfo is a CLR auto-layout record with object references in it, and its
// address is not an address the kernel may write STARTUPINFOW's 104 bytes over.
//
// MEASURED, syscall row at 3469154a95 (2026-09-22): TestGetStartupInfo panics in the boundary's
// own refusal before any native code runs -- `syscall: argument 0 is a managed pointer token, not
// an address -- the pointee is reference-bearing` (dll_windows.cs refuseManagedPointerTokens). That
// refusal is the correct answer for the generated body; this file is what the refusal asks for.
// The row read 64 matched + 1 diverged; syscall is banked at 65.
//
// THE POINTER FIELDS ARE FAITHFUL, not approximated. GetStartupInfoW fills lpDesktop and lpTitle
// with addresses of strings in the process's own startup parameters, which live, unmoved, for the
// life of the process. A pointer the kernel hands out into native memory is exactly what golib's
// native-backed box kind models: `(ж<T>)(uintptr)address` is a NativeBox that reads and writes
// through that address, compares by it, and is nil for a zero address -- Go's
// `(*T)(unsafe.Pointer(uintptr(0))) == nil`. The reserved slots are transcribed the same way so the
// wrapper's contract stays "fills the record"; Go's blank fields cannot be read by any caller, but
// the record is the kernel's, whole.
//
// THE CALL is unchanged from the generated body -- same LazyProc, same syscall.Syscall trampoline,
// same discarded result (GetStartupInfoW returns void) -- and only the memory the argument names is
// different, on the zsyscall_windows_version_impl.cs precedent (internal/syscall/windows).
