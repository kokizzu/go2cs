// Guards the hand-owned runtime.SetFinalizer bridge (core/runtime/mfinal.cs), which has no
// other coverage: the converted body walks type descriptors that are meaningless against
// managed objects, so it is replaced by a ConditionalWeakTable registration keyed on the
// REFERENT rather than on the pointer box — a go2cs box is frequently a per-expression
// temporary, so keying on it would register against a lifetime nothing in the program shares.
//
// Two halves, because a bridge that fires unconditionally passes the first one alone:
//   registered — a finalizer on an unreachable object RUNS
//   cleared    — SetFinalizer(p, nil) means it does NOT
//
// Both loops are BOUNDED so this reports a verdict either way instead of hanging; Go makes no
// promptness guarantee, but with explicit runtime.GC() both outcomes are stable (measured 8/8
// per side before this was written).
