.SYNOPSIS
    Project-graph integrity guard, in two parts: (1) the set of behavioral test .csproj files on disk
    is exactly the set registered in go2cs.slnx, and (2) the emitted src\core project-reference graph
    is ACYCLIC for every $(GoTargetOS). Catches a test (or sibling library sub-project) that was
    committed but never added to the solution, and a converter emission that closes a reference cycle.

.DESCRIPTION
    A behavioral test can pull in a sibling library project via <ProjectReference> -- e.g.
    GoNamespaceShadow references nsshadowlib\go.nsshadow.csproj. The BehavioralRunner / MSTest harness
    builds each test .csproj *by path* with $(SolutionDir) set, so a transitive ProjectReference
    resolves and the suite stays green EVEN WHEN the referenced project is missing from go2cs.slnx.
    The gap only bites when go2cs.slnx is opened/built in Visual Studio: the unregistered project is
    not a solution member, so VS builds it without the Debug+SolutionDir context and its $(go2csPath)
    references (core\golib, core\math, gen\go2cs-gen) fail to resolve (CS0246/CS0234). That is exactly
    how nsshadow slipped through (added in 96eff53cd, never registered until 53dd2497e).

    The invariant that prevents this: every .csproj physically under tests\Behavioral is registered as
    a <Project Path="..."> in go2cs.slnx, and vice-versa. This script checks that equality both ways:
      - on disk but NOT in the solution  =>  forgot to register it (the build-breaking gap)
      - in the solution but NOT on disk  =>  dangling registration (renamed / deleted project)

    A second, related invariant guards the PATH CASING of the tracked tree: every tracked path under the
    behavioral tree must be spelled exactly src/tests/Behavioral/... On Windows a `git add .` / `git add -A`
    records the ON-DISK directory casing, so a drifted src\Tests silently banks a test at
    src/Tests/Behavioral/... -- the same directory here, a SECOND one on a case-sensitive filesystem, where
    the solution's lowercase registration stops resolving. Checks 1-3 cannot see it (they compare
    case-insensitively on a case-insensitive filesystem), so this one reads the git index directly.

    The FIFTH invariant is about a different graph and a different failure: the emitted corpus's
    PROJECT-REFERENCE graph must be acyclic. C# project references are compile-time edges, so a cycle
    is not a slow build -- it is MSB4006 ("there is a circular dependency"), and every project in the
    cycle stops building. Go's own import graph is acyclic by construction, so an emission derived
    only from imports cannot produce one; what can is a reference the converter introduces that Go's
    graph does not contain -- a `//go:linkname` forwarding property, whose ProjectReference points
    wherever the directive names, in either direction. That is W1
    (docs\phase4\DESIGN-linkname-push-cycles.md): a `-tests` conversion of `runtime` emitted
    `runtime -> internal/syscall/windows`, and because Go's own imports contain
    `internal/syscall/windows -> syscall -> runtime`, the result is a cycle NO conversion order can
    undo. It was found by hand, and nothing in the tree would have caught it.

    The invariant this makes mechanical is narrower than "-tests must not rewrite the production
    emission" (which contradicts the standing restore doctrine -- four documented closure families
    legitimately differ) and sharper than "the push must not add a reference":

        A -tests conversion's production emission may differ from -stdlib's only in ways that do
        not change the project GRAPH.

    So this check reads the emitted .csproj files themselves -- the artifact, not the converter's
    intent -- and DFSes them once per $(GoTargetOS), because the per-GOOS <ItemGroup> blocks make
    each target a DIFFERENT graph (layout L3, docs\phase4\DESIGN-multiplatform-corpus.md). All three
    emitted flavors are checked: a cycle on the linux graph is just as fatal to the linux build as a
    windows one is to the corpus reference target.

    POSITIVE CONTROL (a green that cannot go red is not a measurement). -InjectReference adds an edge
    to the parsed graph in memory, so the assertion can be made to fail on demand without touching a
    tracked file:

        ./check-solution-integrity.ps1 -TargetOS windows -InjectReference 'runtime=internal/syscall/windows'

    must report EXACTLY these six cycles and exit 1 -- W1's own set, independently reproduced in
    DESIGN-linkname-push-cycles.md section 1.3:

        errors -> internal/reflectlite -> runtime -> internal/syscall/windows -> errors
        runtime -> internal/syscall/windows -> runtime
        runtime -> internal/syscall/windows -> sync -> runtime
        errors -> internal/reflectlite -> runtime -> internal/syscall/windows -> syscall -> errors
        errors -> internal/reflectlite -> runtime -> internal/syscall/windows -> syscall -> internal/oserror -> errors
        runtime -> internal/syscall/windows -> syscall -> runtime

    Pure static analysis over the file tree, the .slnx text, the git index and the corpus .csproj XML:
    no build, no transpile, no run (~6s for all three target flavors on the i7-5820K, of which the
    cycle DFS is ~4s). Runs automatically as the preflight step of check-no-regression.ps1; also
    runnable standalone.
