// Go zeroes a shift whose count reaches the operand width (a signed right shift sign-extends); C#'s
// native shift MASKS the count. Runtime counts come from a slice so nothing folds to a constant, and
// several are >= width. The converter must route these through golib's Go-semantics Rsh/Lsh guard,
// while a syntactically MASKED / MODULO'd count (provably < width) must stay the native shift.

// A NAMED integer type takes a different route entirely: its shift resolves through the go2cs-gen
// wrapper operator, not through the converter's guard, so that operator has to carry the same
// semantics. math/big's Word is exactly this shape — lehmerSimulate reads `A.abs[n-2] >> (_W - h)`,
// which for a normalized operand is a shift by exactly the width. Masked, it returns the word
// instead of 0, and the corrupted Lehmer cosequences made GCD's loop stop converging: an infinite
// loop in math/big, reached from crypto/elliptic's generic CurveParams path.
