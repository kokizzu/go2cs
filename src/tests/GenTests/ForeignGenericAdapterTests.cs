/// adapter was 32 errors in one file:
/// </para>
/// <list type="bullet">
///   <item>the adapter NAME composed from <c>GetFullTypeName</c>, which spells a generic as
///   <c>Name&lt;typeArgs&gt;</c> — so the argument list landed INSIDE the class identifier
///   (<c>class sync_HashTrieMap&lt;Object, Object&gt;жmapInterface</c>): CS0692 for the two type
///   parameters both named <c>Object</c>, then the ctor parsed as a method and every member fell
///   into the enclosing static partial class (CS0708 ×17, CS0540 ×10, CS0548, CS0050);</item>
///   <item>the WRAPPED type came from the same helper, whose generic case drops everything left of
///   the name, so <c>GlobalQualify</c> found no <c>go.</c> prefix to qualify and
///   <c>ж&lt;HashTrieMap&lt;object, object&gt;&gt;</c> bound nothing: CS0246 ×2.</item>
/// </list>
/// <para>
/// A CLOSED foreign instantiation is the only foreign-generic form that can reach here — an
/// assembly-level attribute cannot name an open one — so it takes a NON-generic adapter over the
/// closed type: the identifier is the package-qualified BARE name, and the type arguments live only
/// in the wrapped type. The open-generic route the LOCAL branch takes is unrepresentable here, and
/// not for want of a constraint (the converted <c>HashTrieMap&lt;K, V&gt;</c> declares none): the
/// interface is non-generic and typed at the CLOSED arguments (<c>Load(any) (any, bool)</c>) while
/// the struct's extensions are typed at the parameters, so an adapter open over <c>&lt;K, V&gt;</c>
/// would pass <c>object</c> where <c>K</c> is expected — CS1503 on every member.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A THIRD facet of the same defect is guarded by
/// <see cref="AForeignClosedGenericAdapterForwardsThroughThePackageClassStatic"/>: the metadata scan
/// that finds a foreign struct's box extensions compared a CONSTRUCTED generic against the OPEN
/// receiver those extensions declare, so it bound nothing and every member fell back to
/// <c>m_box.Value.&lt;name&gt;</c> — which binds nothing either, because a Go pointer-receiver
/// method is a package-class extension and not an instance member.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// ⚠ COLLISION HAZARD, stated rather than defended against. The foreign name carries no
/// per-instantiation suffix, so two DIFFERENT closed instantiations of one foreign generic against
/// one interface compose one class twice (CS0102). A suffix cannot be used: the CONVERTER composes
/// the same name at the cast site and spells the arguments in Go-alias form (<c>any</c>) where this
/// generator spells them in C# keyword form (<c>object</c>), so a name derived from the argument
/// spelling cannot be kept in sync across the two halves. The generator's de-duplication key is the
/// CLOSED instantiation, so that case fails LOUDLY at CS0102 rather than silently binding the first
/// instantiation's arguments. Unreachable from Go whenever the interface mentions the type
/// arguments, which is the only case that reaches this branch at all; no corpus instance.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// ⚠ The two CONTROLS are green before and after the fix, and they are read from the generated TEXT
/// rather than from a compile, deliberately: before the fix the shared compilation cannot compile at
/// all (the subject's adapter is in it), so a control phrased as "the compilation is clean" would be
/// red for a reason that has nothing to do with the axis it guards. The local-generic arm
/// (<c>nistCurve&lt;Point&gt;</c>'s shape) and the foreign NON-generic arm (<c>testing_TжTB</c>'s
/// shape) sit in the SAME two compilations as the subject, so the three differ on exactly the two
