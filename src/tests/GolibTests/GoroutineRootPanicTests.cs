    // The goroutine root has two host hooks and they answer different questions. A NON-panic
    // exception may be CONTAINED — a host running many independent Go programs in one process wants
    // one program's managed defect to fail one program. A PANIC may only be OBSERVED: Go kills the
    // process on an unrecovered panic in any goroutine, converted code must do the same, and the
    // differential oracle depends on it.
    //
    // Observation exists because that fatal path was otherwise FRAMELESS — golib's backstop prints
    // the panic VALUE and exits, which is Go's own report for a program and useless to a host trying
    // to say WHICH test died and WHERE. net/rpc/jsonrpc is the case that made it matter: a panic on
    // an rpc goroutine took the test host down with no frame at all, and the package recorded zero
    // verdicts where six had already passed.
    //
    // Goroutine.Run — the root, minus the queueing — is called directly here for a reason the real
    // path cannot offer: on a pool thread the escaping panic is by definition unhandled, and the
    // process dies before an assertion could run. On the caller's own thread the SAME root runs the
    // same filters and the panic lands in the test's catch instead of in the runtime's.
