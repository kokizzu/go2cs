// Go's contract for a pointer into NATIVE memory is ADDRESS identity: an unsafe.Pointer round-tripped
// through uintptr and back is the same pointer. runtime's lfnodeValidate asserts exactly that --
// `lfstackUnpack(lfstackPack(node, ^uintptr(0))) != node` -- over `&n.LFNode`, a FIELD reference into a
// persistentalloc'd node. The unpacked pointer is a NativeBox over the same address; equality compared
// only within a kind, so `!=` read true and Go's FATAL throw("bad lfnode address") ended the runtime
// row's test host after 186 of 10,891 results (measured 2026-09-22, once sysAllocOS returned real pages).
