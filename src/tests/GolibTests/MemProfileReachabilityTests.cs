/// Guards the memory profile's on/off decision (class M, M1; COORD ruling 2026-09-27, option (a)), the
/// managed analog of Go's disableMemoryProfiling: Go's linker sets it when runtime.memProfileInternal is
/// unreachable, and the runtime then starts with MemProfileRate 0. Here the rate stays at Go's default only
/// when runtime.pprof is in the program's STATIC assembly closure (its deps.json list, read once at
/// runtime's module initialisation), never from the assemblies loaded so far, which load lazily. Red
/// against the first M1 cut, which kept the rate on in every program.
/// The predicate is golib's (COORD ruling 2026-09-29 08:43, map-growth option (a)): one answer, read by
/// runtime's module initializer for the rate and folded by the JIT into the map store's growth branch.
/// Red against cb33faec95, where the predicate was runtime's and golib had no answer to fold; the
/// compiled-in arm is red against 868157de98, where a list without runtime.pprof answered "unreachable"
/// for runtime/pprof's own test binary.
