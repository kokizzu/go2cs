    // WHY THIS EXISTS, and why the ORDER is the arm.
    //
    // Go's TempDir registers ONE cleanup — the removal of the test's PARENT temp directory — on the
    // FIRST call (testing.go:1265-1269); later calls only number a child inside it and register
    // nothing. Until 2026-09-15 this host registered a cleanup PER CALL, and because cleanups run
    // LAST-IN-FIRST-OUT that granularity became an ORDER: a Chdir restore registered BETWEEN two
    // TempDir calls ran AFTER the later child's removal. Windows refuses to delete the directory a
    // process stands in, so the removal failed and the host reported an infrastructure error.
    //
    // THE SHAPE IS os's OWN TEST. TestChdirAndGetwd does t.Chdir(t.TempDir()), takes two more
    // TempDirs and chdirs into the last of them; it failed 3 of 3 in a fresh os host with "The
    // process cannot access the file ... because it is being used by another process" on the THIRD
    // directory, while `go test` passed it every time. TestProgWideChdir — one TempDir, registered
    // BEFORE its Chdir — passed on the same host, which is the contrast that located the order.
    //
    // ⚠ WHY THIS FILE IS IN THE WINDOWS/UNSET COMPILE GROUP. The wrong order is platform-independent,
    // but the FAILURE is not: Linux happily unlinks a directory that is some process's working
    // directory, so on Linux this arm would pass with the defect present and guard nothing. A guard
    // placed where it cannot go red reads green forever, so it is compiled where it can fail.
    //
    // RED-FIRST, measured before the fix was believed: with the per-call registration restored, the
    // arm FAILS on the infrastructure assertion below, naming the directory the process stands in.
