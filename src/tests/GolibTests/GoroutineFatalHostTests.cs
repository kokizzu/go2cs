// The standing guard for the test host's goroutine-death path -- attribute, flush, DIE.
//
// WHY IT LIVES HERE. No behavioral project can reach this: a behavioral test is a standalone program
// that references golib and fmt, never core/testing, so golib's own process-death fidelity is what
// GoroutinePanicExitCode guards and the HOST path had nothing. This is the same reason
// TestExecutionOutputCapTests lives in GolibTests, and it follows that precedent's shape -- build the
// host machinery in-process and drive it directly.
//
// WHAT IT IS GUARDING, and why the die half is the point. The host used to CONTAIN an unhandled
// non-panic exception escaping a goroutine, so one test's failure would not cost the run. Measured,
// that inverts: recording a failure cannot UNBLOCK whatever the dead goroutine was going to signal.
// A goroutine that dies before its `wg.Done()` leaves the test parked in `sync.Wait` forever, the
// package deadline fires, and the timeout path discards every verdict -- so containment did not save
// one test, it lost the package AND the evidence.
//
// The measured instance was reflect's TestOffsetLock: four goroutines each threw
// `NotImplementedException: addReflectOff` in under a second, and CONTAINED that presented as an
// unbounded hang which ate a 40-minute deadline and truncated the suite to 99 pass / 93 fail / 1
// skip. The exception was being recorded correctly the whole time and nobody could see it.
//
// So the assertion that matters is the EXIT. Attribution and the flush are observable from their own
// artifacts and were never really in doubt; "and then the process ended with 2" is the half that
// converts a hang into a red, and it is the half a future edit could quietly drop while every other
// assertion here still passed.
