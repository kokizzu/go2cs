/// The fork this guards: <c>array&lt;E&gt;</c> is a MANAGED struct whose first field is an

/// <c>(ж&lt;array&lt;E&gt;&gt;)(uintptr)addr</c> over genuinely-native memory reinterprets whatever
/// lives there AS A MANAGED REFERENCE and dereferences it. Zeroed memory reads a length of 0, a
/// silent wrong answer; filled memory reads a length off the data bytes and returns a number instead
/// of faulting, by luck.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// ⚠ THE DISCRIMINATOR IS PROVENANCE, NOT T, and these arms are arranged to say so in both
/// directions. A floor keyed on T alone was ratified and then withdrawn on lane R's measured
/// disproof — 6 of 609 behavioral tests red, because pinned-managed round-trips over Go-legal
/// reinterprets arrive at this same operator. So the admitted arm below is as load-bearing as the
/// refused one: a pinned-managed address must still convert, because it RESOLVES.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This file does not duplicate <see cref="ArrayShapeReinterpretTests"/>. That one is the WITNESS
/// for the defect and exercises a pinned-managed address, which is why the floor leaves it
/// untouched — its note says it should be RE-READ rather than deleted if the arc lands, and the
/// reading is that its address has a provenance record and is admitted by design.
