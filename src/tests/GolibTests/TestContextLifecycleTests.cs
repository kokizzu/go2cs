    // WHY THIS EXISTS.
    //
    // Go 1.24 added TB.Context, and the first implementation of it here had TWO defects, both from
    // reasoning about the member instead of reading it:
    //
    //   1. It called TryEnsureOwner, copied from the neighbouring Setenv. Go's Context is
    //      `checkFuzzFn; return c.ctx` -- NO goroutine restriction of any kind -- and calling
    //      t.Context() from a spawned goroutine is most of what a test context is FOR. TryEnsureOwner
    //      does not merely refuse: it sets InfrastructureFailed and FAILS the test, so an ordinary
    //      Go pattern became an infrastructure failure.
    //   2. Its refusal path returned context.Background() -- a DIFFERENT context, one that never
    //      cancels -- so anything past the guard got a Done() that never fires. That is the quieter
    //      half and the half that would have been diagnosed as something else.
    //
    // Neither was reachable by any standing gate: nothing at go1.23.12 calls Context, so the member
    // is inert to the corpus and would have arrived live at the hop. These arms are what stand in
    // for the coverage the hop's own `testing` row will eventually provide.

    {

        return new TestExecution(runner, name, null, "guard.go", 1);
    }

    // Go: "Successive calls return the same context." A per-call context would give each caller its
    // own cancellation and silently break any code that stores one and selects on it elsewhere.

    // wait on resources that shut down on Done(); cancel AFTER the cleanup phase and every such
    // cleanup blocks to its own deadline instead. Asserted from inside a cleanup, which is the only
    // place the ordering is observable.
