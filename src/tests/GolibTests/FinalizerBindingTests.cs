    // WHY, derived rather than remembered (the i7's re-gate at c1fefa431 read Arm4 RED and Arm8
    // GREEN against this comment's predicted 7+8, and the derivation below reproduces that):
    //
    //   * Arms 2, 7, 8 and 9 survive the neuter through **case 4**. `TryBoxPointee` (GoReflect.cs:105)
    //     walks the **BaseType chain**, so StandardBox<nint>, FieldRefBox<nint> and ElemRefBox<nint>
    //     all resolve to pointee `nint`, unnamed; `finElem == etypElem` holds, the unnamed gate holds,
    //     and TryConvertTo is the identity, so the referent passes through and AreSame still holds.
    //   * Arm 3 binds at **case 2** (`fint == typeof(object)`), which the neuter does not touch.
    //   * Arm 1 never used case 1 at all -- a named pointer wrapper does NOT inherit its box, so
    //     assignability is false for it and it has always bound at case 4.
    //   * Arms 5 and 6 are refusals already (case-4 fall-through and the arity check).
    //   * **Arm 4 is the one that moves.** Case 3's own comment records why: an interface the
    //     referent's type directly implements "is already handled by case 1's assignability test
    //     above; only the duck-typed shell can reach here now". With case 1 neutered to equality,
    //     Arm 4 falls into case 3, whose only remaining path is AdapterBinder.TryCreate -- which
    //     either refuses outright or returns a SHELL, and a shell is not the referent, so the
    //     AreSame assertion fails either way.
    //
    // ⚠ THE CONSEQUENCE, STATED PLAINLY BECAUSE IT NARROWS WHAT CASE 1 BUYS: case 1's UNIQUE
    // contribution over the other three cases is the **directly-implemented interface**. The box-family
    // shapes that motivated it (arms 7, 8, 9) are ALSO reachable through case 4. Case 1 is still
    // right -- it is Go's own rule, it short-circuits before the structural gate, and Arm 4 needs it --
    // but "the fix for the box family" overstates it, and the c1fefa431 announce said exactly that.
