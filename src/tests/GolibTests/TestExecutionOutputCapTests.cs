    // WHY THIS EXISTS, and why it is a GolibTests file.
    //
    // A test's log output is a diagnostic; unbounded, it is the thing that kills the host. On
    // sync/atomic's TestHammerStoreLoad a late-goroutine Fatalf storm drove one execution's log to a
    // 693 MB join, RecordGoroutinePanic went OutOfMemory building it INSIDE the fatal path, and the
    // process died instead of reporting -- losing 72 of 108 verdicts. Whether the storm won that
    // race was host-dependent, so the same package read 104/108 on one machine and 35/108 on
    // another. Coordinator Ruling A (2026-08-20) queued the bound as harness robustness: "a false
    // host-dependence the harness owes nobody."
    //
    // The Phase-4 test HOST has no _test.go anywhere and no behavioral test can reach it -- a
    // converted suite exercises it only by being run, which is precisely the path a robustness guard
    // must not depend on (the failure being guarded against is the run dying). So it takes the same
    // route Sha3ReinterpretVectorTests took one tier down: an MSTest guard binding the converted
    // package directly.
    //
    // What is pinned here is the BOUND, not the OOM. Reproducing 693 MB in a unit test would BE the
    // storm -- minutes and gigabytes to re-observe a thing the bound makes unreachable. The
    // invariant is asserted against the host's own constants rather than a magic number, so it
    // survives a retune of either cap.
