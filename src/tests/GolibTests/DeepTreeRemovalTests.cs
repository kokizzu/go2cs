    // WHY THIS EXISTS. os's TestGetwdDeep chdirs one 200-byte name at a time until its working
    // directory passes PATH_MAX, and leaves that tree in its TempDir. `go test` removes it: Go's
    // os.RemoveAll works relative to directory descriptors (removeall_at.go), so no call ever names a
    // path longer than one component. .NET's recursive delete names FULL paths, and on Linux both of
    // the host's routes threw ArgumentException ("The value cannot be an empty string") once a path
    // passed PATH_MAX — measured 2026-09-26 on the WSL arm, in a standalone .NET 10 program as well:
    //
    //   * TestExecution.RemoveAll (the TempDir cleanup): TestGetwdDeep PASSED in C# and was then
    //     reported as an infrastructure-error by its own cleanup — os linux family 3.
    //   * PackageAncestry.Delete (the sandbox teardown and the next run's reclaim): the stranded
    //     sandbox made ReclaimAbandonedSandboxes throw out of TryStage, so the NEXT os run on the box
    //     died before its first test, with zero C# results.
    //
    // ⚠ Compiled for GoTargetOS=linux only (GolibTests.csproj): Windows names long paths natively,
    // so there these arms would pass with the defect present and guard nothing.

    // A path this deep in bytes is past Linux's PATH_MAX (4096) with room to spare.
