    // WHY THIS EXISTS, and why it is a measurement rather than a guard.
    //
    // `math/big`'s TestMulUnbalanced reads MemStats.TotalAlloc around ONE nat.mul inside a
    // GOMAXPROCS(1) window and bounds the delta at 10x the input size. On the converted side the
    // ratio reads 51, and the row (224 of math/big's 226 verdicts ride behind it) has TWO candidate
    // roots that no measurement had yet separated:
    //
    //   (1) the converted nat.mul genuinely allocates ~5x what Go's does;
    //   (2) GetTotalAllocatedBytes(precise: false) is PROCESS-WIDE and unsynchronized, so the window
    //       catches other threads' allocations where Go's GOMAXPROCS(1) window catches almost none.
    //
    // Three numbers around one window separate them, and the design fixed the decision rule in
    // advance (§5.4) so this probe cannot be read after the fact to say what one hoped:
    //
    //   P = GC.GetTotalAllocatedBytes(precise: true) delta  -- process-wide, exact
    //   T = GC.GetAllocatedBytesForCurrentThread() delta    -- this thread only, pollution-free
    //   C = AllocationCounter.CurrentThreadCount delta      -- golib OBJECTS on this thread
    //
    //   T ~= P (within a few %)  => root (1). The window's allocation is the code under test's own;
    //                               the row routes to the zh-box reduction arc, and T / inputSize
    //                               says directly whether it could ever clear the 10x bound.
    //   T << P                   => root (2). The process-wide read is catching other threads and
    //                               the test's premise does not hold in the managed model; §5.5
    //                               routes that to reopening scheduler OQ8, NOT to a disclosure.
    //
    // A per-thread read is SOUND here (§5.2): Goroutine.Start gives each goroutine its own dedicated
    // thread for its whole life, the converted test host runs each test body on its own thread, and
    // nat.mul spawns nothing -- so the whole measured window runs on one thread. Soundness as a
    // MEASUREMENT is not soundness as a FIELD, though: §5.3 refuses to redefine TotalAlloc per-thread
    // (expvar publishes it over HTTP as a process quantity, and net/textproto's banked row measures
    // across it), which is exactly why this is an experiment and can run before anything ships.
    //
    // Faithfulness to the row. Go's test builds x = rndNat(50000) and y = rndNat(40) -- 50,000 and 40
    // WORDS -- and computes inputSize = (len(x)+len(y)) * _S = 400,320 bytes. `nat` is
    // package-internal, so this probe drives the same code path through the public surface:
    // Int.SetBits takes a raw little-endian []Word, and Int.Mul with distinct operands reaches
    // nat.mul with the same unbalanced shape. The words are a deterministic xorshift rather than
    // rndNat's math/rand, because nat.mul's allocation behavior is a function of LENGTH, not value,
    // and a deterministic operand makes the reading reproducible. P is reported against the row's
    // own banked readings (20,487,200 B at r57a; 20,499,128 B at zh-box A3) as the CONTROL that this
    // probe reproduces the row at all -- a P far from those would mean the probe is measuring
    // something else and no conclusion about T follows.
