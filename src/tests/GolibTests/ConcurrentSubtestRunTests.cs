    // WHY THIS EXISTS.
    //
    // Go's testing places NO goroutine restriction on t.Run. It restricts FailNow and Fatal to the
    // test's own goroutine -- those unwind the frame -- and this host keeps that. But Run is callable
    // from anywhere, and Go pins it with TWO of its own tests, both regression tests for
    // go.dev/issue/64402:
    //
    //   TestConcurrentRun  starts two goroutines that each call t.Run on the SAME parent
    //   TestParentRun      calls t1.Run from inside t2's body (t1.Run, not t2.Run)
    //
    // This host refused both until 2026-09-04, via an owner-thread check on Run, and the two
    // refusals failed DIFFERENTLY -- which is why only one of them was visible. TestParentRun merely
    // reported an infrastructure error and silently lost its inner subtest. TestConcurrentRun
    // DEADLOCKED: a refused Run never runs the body, so the body's ready.Done() never happens, the
    // parent's ready.Wait() blocks forever, and the package deadline kills the entire run. That is
    // what made `testing`'s own row unmeasurable -- one defect, 49 verdicts unreachable behind it.
    //
    // The host has no _test.go and no behavioral test can reach it, so this takes the route
    // TestExecutionOutputCapTests documents: an MSTest guard binding the converted package directly.
    //
    // NEGATIVE CONTROL, measured 2026-09-04: with the owner check restored on Run, ConcurrentRun
    // fails on `both subtest bodies must have run` (the bodies never execute) rather than hanging --
    // the latch's timeout is what converts the production deadlock into a reportable failure here, so
    // the guard states the defect instead of reproducing it as a hung suite. ParentRun fails on
    // `the inner subtest body must have run`.

    private static TestRunner NewRunner() =>
        new(new TestRegistry("guard", []), new TestOptions(),
            new TestReporter("guard", json: false, verbose: false), ".", ".");

    // Long enough that a healthy run never reaches it, short enough that a REGRESSION reports a
    // failure instead of hanging the suite. A deadlock is the failure mode being guarded against, so
    // the guard must not be able to reproduce it.
