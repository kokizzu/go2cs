// The ONE definition of "is this behavioral package native to this host", shared by the two
// harnesses that enumerate behavioral packages: BehavioralRunner and the MSTest BehavioralTestBase.
// LINKED into both by path, for the same reason ConverterBuildInputs.cs is -- the runners take no
// assembly dependency on each other, so a shared assembly is not available, and three copies of a
// predicate is three chances for them to disagree about which packages a host may measure.
//
// The class this gates bites in BOTH directions and was invisible in each until it was named. A
// behavioral package whose Go source calls unix-only syscall API (Socketpair, UnixRights, SendmsgN)
// cannot be TYPE-CHECKED on Windows; one calling FindFirstFile or the WSA surface cannot be
// type-checked on Linux. The converter then emits a best-effort conversion, and every harness
// reported the result as a failure or -- worse -- as a byte-identical pass over a file it never
// regenerated. Marking the package makes the skip LOUD and BY NAME, which is the point: a silent
// drop from the enumeration would trade one invisible problem for another.
//
// NOT ALWAYS A TYPE-CHECK FAILURE, which is why the skip lines say "cannot measure" rather than
// "cannot type-check". Most marked packages fail at TRANSPILE (the converter cannot type-check
// unix-only or Win32-only syscall API), but LocalTimeZone type-checks anywhere and fails at OUTPUT:
// its converted form reaches syscall.GetTimeZoneInformation and faults on kernel32 off Windows.
// One marker covers both by construction -- a non-native host skips EVERY phase -- so the wording
// is the thing that has to stay honest about which phase actually bites.
//
// TWO AXES since 2026-09-04, GOOS and GOARCH, because the class turned out to have a second half
// nobody had a marker for. Go's own filename rule makes name_GOARCH.go an implicit build constraint,
// so StdLibInternalAbi -- which copies internal/abi and internal/goarch into a package main carrying
// abi_amd64.go, goarch_amd64.go and zgoarch_amd64.go -- does not build on arm64 in GO, measured:
// GOARCH=arm64 go build reports `undefined: IntArgRegs`, `undefined: _ArchFamily` and the Is*
// endianness constants, where GOARCH=amd64 builds clean. Both darwin censuses read the downstream
// half of that on osx-arm64 as `goarch.cs(23,22): error CS0145` while osx-x64 passed every phase.
// The axes are orthogonal and a package may carry both markers; EITHER excluding the host skips it.
