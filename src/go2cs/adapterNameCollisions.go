// A pointer-interface adapter class is named `[<pkg>_]<structSimple>ж<ifaceSimple>` — the STRUCT
// side is package-qualified when foreign (two same-named foreign structs adapting to one interface
// would otherwise compose one class), but the INTERFACE side composes from its bare last-dot
// segment. That is only unambiguous while a given struct adapts to at most one interface of each
// simple name. compress/flate breaks it: its own `Reader` interface and `io.Reader` share a simple
// name, and its tests hand a *bufio.Reader and a *bytes.Reader to NewReader, which casts to both —
// so `bufio_ReaderжReader` and `bytes_ReaderжReader` were each composed TWICE (CS0102 + CS0111 ×6
// + CS8646 per pair). The whole 302-package production corpus has ZERO such collisions; it takes a
// test closure's extra casts to produce one, which is why this survived the Phase-3 milestone.
//
// The rule is COLLISION-CONDITIONAL: within a group of records that compose the same adapter name,
// every FOREIGN interface takes a package qualifier (`bufio_Readerжio_Reader`) and a LOCAL one stays
// bare. Unconditional qualification was measured and rejected — 3,688 construction sites across 644
// adapter names would churn. Because collisions do not occur in production, this is byte-neutral
// there by construction.
//
// The converter and go2cs-gen must agree on every name, and neither may guess: the authority is the
// FINAL set of `[assembly: GoImplement<…>(Pointer = true)]` lines, which is exactly what the
// generator reads and what writePackageInfoFile emits after its alias-covered skip and its
// interface-inheritance prune. Those lines are not known until the whole package has been visited,
// long after the cast sites were rendered — so a cast emits a deferred marker (mirroring
// dynamicTypeOperations' DYNTYPE marker) that resolveAdapterNameMarkers rewrites once the records
// are final.

// THE PASS SEPARATION. A production adapter name is ALREADY COMPILED TEXT. Under the recompile
// model the production `.cs` files become COMPILE ITEMS of the test assembly, where go2cs-gen reads
// the UNION of both halves' records — but that production text was rendered in the production pass,
// against the PRODUCTION record set alone, and nothing can go back and re-render it. So a test-half
// record that lands in a production record's collision group must not be allowed to rename the
// production member: the generator would mint `SHA3жhash_Hash` where sha3.cs spells `SHA3жHash`
// (CS0246/CS0426 ×4, crypto/sha3 — the row's second blocker, the first being the split key
// adapterStructQualifierIsLocal fixes).
//
// The two halves are told apart by a FACET on the record itself. writePackageInfoFile renders every
// record the same way, and the recompile seed is a VERBATIM byte copy of the production
// package_info.cs (convertTestVariants), so the one place the halves are distinguishable is that
// copy: facetProductionPointerRecords stamps `Production = true` onto the seeded records as they
// cross into the test metadata file. Records the test pass then merges in carry no facet, and the
// union still tells the halves apart.
//
// THE RULE (COORD 2026-09-21 23:33), applied here and by the generator's ImplementGenerator:
//
//  1. Collisions are still computed over the UNION — the facet decides naming, never grouping.
//  2. In a colliding group with EXACTLY ONE faceted member, that member keeps the unprefixed name
//     the production text already spells; only the unfaceted members take the interface prefix.
//  3. TWO OR MORE faceted members are a PRODUCTION-pass collision: the production pass already
//     resolved it and the production text already spells the prefixed names, so the ordinary rule
//     applies to the whole group and reproduces exactly those names. Both stand.
//  4. A group with NO faceted member is the ordinary rule — which is every production conversion
//     and every reference model, so this is byte-neutral outside a recompile-model test project.
//
// Only the recompile model populates any of this: both reference models compile the production half
// as a separate ASSEMBLY and seed a test-class-only anchor, so no faceted record exists there, every
// group falls to case 4, and the corpus cannot move.

// minted `ΔhandlerжΔHandler` while every cast site referenced `handlerжΔHandler`, CS0426 ×9. The

// strips it for GROUPING, which is right, and that key must not double as the emitted name.
