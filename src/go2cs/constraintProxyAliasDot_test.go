// q94 (COORD 9fd51104f, from C2's §7 of the RED 8 (a) read). constraintProxyFor qualifies a FOREIGN
// constraint interface by splitting its resolved C# name at the last separator. That split was
// ASCII-DOT ONLY — while getScopeCheckedTypeName's FIRST branch answers with an imported TYPE ALIAS,
// whose separator is TypeAliasDot (`curvesꓸPoint`), because a C# identifier cannot carry a `.`:
// getAliasedTypeName mints the alias form as ReplaceAll(key, ".", TypeAliasDot). Such a qualifier holds
// NO ascii dot, so strings.LastIndex returned -1, the guard declined, and it declined SILENTLY — the
// site dropped to the box leaving the reader of the emitted C# an unexplained CS0310.
//
// ⚠ THE DECLINE IS LATENT IN THE CORPUS, WHICH IS WHY THE RULING ASKS FOR A PLANT.
// Measured with the converter instrumented at the decision point, over crypto/ecdh, crypto/ecdsa and
// both fips140 siblings: the foreign-qualifier branch is ENTERED 140 times, SUCCEEDS 140 times, and the
// decline fires ZERO times — because `ecdsa.Point` (80 lookups) and `ecdh.Point` (60) are never present
// in importedTypeAliases, while siblings in the same table are (`big.Int` 480 hits, `bigmod.Nat` 7). The
// static census agrees from the other side: of 229 glyph aliases corpus-wide only 11 name interfaces,
// and the two self-referential generic constraints (`Point<P>`, `nistPoint<T>`) are not among them. The
// populations do not intersect today, so no fixture drawn from the corpus can reach the path — the alias
// must be PLANTED.
//
// The fixture is loadCrossPackageProxyFixture, REUSED rather than re-minted: it already builds the exact
// shape (owner `curves` declaring `Point[P]`, a consumer instantiating it, both visitors carrying the
// importQueue and referencedForeignPackages that getScopeCheckedTypeName consults), and its own test
// pins the unplanted answer at `curves.P1жPoint`. Three fixtures for one shape would be two too many.

// plantForeignAlias seeds the imported-type alias for a foreign type — the entry the corpus never
// carries for a CONSTRAINT interface — so getScopeCheckedTypeName's alias branch answers with the glyph
// form. importedTypeAliases is package-GLOBAL and a real run re-makes it per package, so the plant
// restores exactly what it displaced: seeding without restoring would leak into sibling tests in this
// same package and could make another test pass or fail for this test's reason.
//
// Note the shape of the value: getAliasedTypeName returns ReplaceAll(KEY, ".", TypeAliasDot) for a
// non-const entry, so the target governs EXISTENCE only and the rendered qualifier is derived from the
// key. The target is therefore written as what a real alias would hold, not as the expected output.

	// documents for constraintProxies.
	//
	// ⚠ THE PLANT MUST NOT MUTATE THE MAP IT FOUND. Restoring the map REFERENCE is a NO-OP whenever the
	// global is already non-nil, because the saved reference and the mutated object are the same map:
	// the planted key survives the restore and leaks into every later test in the package. That is not
	// hypothetical. It failed TestConstraintProxyConsumerNamesTheOwnersProxy,
	// TestConstraintProxyConsumerWithoutTheInterfaceImportQualifiesFully and this file's own ascii-dot
	// bound under the FULL SUITE, while passing under `-run ConstraintProxy`, where nothing had
	// populated the global first and the nil restore was accidentally correct.
	//
	// So the plant is COPY-ON-WRITE: build a fresh map carrying the previous contents plus the plant,
	// install that, and put the original object back untouched. Correct whether or not the global was
	// nil, and — the property that matters — independent of what ran before.

// form up to and including the separator, and the proxy name is element + PointerPrefix+interface as
// ImplementGenerator spells it — `curvesꓸ` + `P1жPoint`. A containment assertion would also pass on a
