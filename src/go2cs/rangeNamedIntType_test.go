// RANGE-OVER-INT KEEPS THE OPERAND'S NAMED TYPE. Go gives the loop variable of `for i := range n`
// the type of n, so `for days := range absDays(1e6)` gives `days` the type `absDays` and every
// method on that type must bind. The emission cast the operand down to its underlying width and
// named that width as range<T>'s type argument, so the variable came out a bare `ulong`: time's
// abs_test.go calls `.split()`, `.date()` and `.yearYday()` on it, and every one failed CS1929
// with three CS8130 deconstructions downstream — six errors, one root.
//
// ⚠ THE CONSTRAINT ADMITS THE NAMED TYPE, which is what makes the type argument the right fix
// rather than a declared loop-variable type plus a cast. range<T>'s bound is
// `struct, IComparisonOperators<T, T, bool>, IIncrementOperators<T>` — the operator pair the loop
// body uses, narrowed to exactly that so golib's hand-written `uintptr` could bind (builtin.cs
// says so in its own remark) — and a converted `[GoType("num:…")]` type declares both from
// InheritedTypeTemplate. So the named type needs nothing added to it, and the emission reads like
// the Go instead of spelling two conversions Go does not have.
//
// ⚠ SCOPE, and the controls that hold it: a named type over plain `int` ALREADY emits the bare
// `range(expr)` form, where C#'s inference binds T to the named type by itself — right today, and
// naming the argument there would move corpus bytes for nothing. An UNNAMED non-`int` width keeps
// the underlying-width argument it always had. Both are armed below, and both were green before
// this change.
