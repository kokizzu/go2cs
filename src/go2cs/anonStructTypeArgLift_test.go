// Guards the lift of a NON-EMPTY anonymous struct reached ONLY through a generic TYPE-ARGUMENT
// position. `reflect.TypeFor[struct{ f int }]()` is the measured shape: it appears in Go 1.24's
// reflect test sources (all_test.go:3547 inside the pre-existing TestAllocations, and :6921 inside
// the new TestTypeFieldReadOnly) and in no earlier release, and it made the whole `reflect` row
// unreadable — `go2cs -tests -test-action all` exited 1 at CONVERT, in both build configurations,
// before any build, run or comparison could happen.
//
// The cause was a REGISTRATION gap, not a resolution one. visitStructType publishes a lifted
// anonymous struct into the package-wide dedup registry only for a package-level lift or one at a
// call boundary (`!v.inFunction || v.liftAtCallBoundary`); a type argument is a position that gate
// never enumerated, so a function-scoped one minted no lift at all and the deferred marker fell
// through to "emit the raw Go signature and record the site".
//
// ⚠ THE FIXTURE CARRIES THE SHAPE AT **TWO** SITES WITH **ONE** SIGNATURE ON PURPOSE. The resolver
// warns and records once per SIGNATURE, not once per site, so a guard anchored on the reported
// line alone would go green on a fix that repaired one occurrence and left the other emitting raw
// Go. That is exactly how the real defect presented: "1 unresolved dynamic type(s)" named
// all_test.cs(4201) while all_test.cs(8451) carried the same raw text unmentioned.
//
// The two controls in the same fixture are what make the trigger one axis rather than three:
// `struct{}` and a named type argument both resolve on the BROKEN converter, so the guard cannot
// be satisfied by anything as broad as "anonymous type arguments do not work".
