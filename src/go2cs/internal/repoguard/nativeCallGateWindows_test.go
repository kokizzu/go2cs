// WHAT THIS WATCHES, AND WHY IT IS A GATE AND NOT A CENSUS.
//
// The converted Windows runtime reaches the kernel through one funnel. Every stdcall0..stdcall12
// delegates to stdcall(fn) (runtime/windows/os_windows.cs:959), whose only outward call is
// asmcgocall(asmstdcallAddr, …) at :973, and asmstdcall is Go's assembly -- declared bodyless at
// os_windows.cs:199, realized nowhere in src/core, and filled by PartialStubGenerator
// (src/gen/go2cs-gen/PartialStubGenerator.cs:111) with
//
//	throw new NotImplementedException("<identifier>: no implementation reached this compilation …")
//
// so every one of the 102 stdcallN call sites in runtime/windows is dead behind it. Three hand-own
// headers already state that consequence in words: runtime/windows/os_windows_impl.cs:19 and :95,
// runtime/windows/signal_windows_impl.cs:27, and internal/poll/windows/runtime_netpoll_impl.cs:16.
//
// That is what makes a per-site census the wrong instrument here. C1's q90 step 1 (mailbox 7a181d2a0)
// took the reachability reading COORD's ruling asks for BEFORE any census: runtime/windows
// os_windows.cs profilem() builds a ж<context> over a byte array and hands it to _GetThreadContext --
// textbook native-boundary fork (ii) -- and it is REFERENCED but UNREACHABLE, with five throwing gates
// between runtime/pprof's StartCPUProfile and the box. A declared set of 102 rows would repeat one
// sentence 102 times, every row would go live or stay dead together, and keeping it in step with the
// corpus would be the drifted-instrument-copy fault by construction. So the population is watched
// through its GATE, and the day the gate is realized this guard goes red and says the per-site census
// is owed. COORD ruled that shape at mailbox abf5362ea.
//
// TWO EXCEPTIONS THIS GUARD CARRIES IN ITS OWN TEXT, because the short version of its finding is
// wrong in both directions:
//
//	A REALIZED SYMBOL CAN STILL BE DEAD. write1 (os_windows.cs:549) has a real body and its first act
//	is stdcall1(_GetStdHandle, …). It is dead BY THE GATE. A guard scoring symbols rather than the
//	gate would have called it live.
//
//	THE GATE IS NOT THE ONLY DOOR. signal_windows_impl.cs:75 declares SetConsoleCtrlHandlerNative as
//	[LibraryImport("kernel32.dll")] -- a LIVE native call that never touches asmstdcall. So this guard
//	prints the interop sites as a reading and its red says "every stdcallN site is dead behind this
//	gate", NEVER "nothing in runtime/windows reaches the kernel".
//
// THE THREE BUCKETS, and why there are three. A realization census that asks only "does a body exist"
// is wrong in both directions, and C1's own first census of this was wrong BOTH ways in one run
// (mailbox 83c8d047f §5): a TUPLE RETURN TYPE breaks a pattern that forbids parentheses before the
// name -- `public static partial (uintptr r1, uintptr r2, uintptr errno) Syscall6(…)` -- and a
// [LibraryImport] / [DllImport] partial is BODYLESS BY DESIGN, realized by the interop source
// generator rather than by PartialStubGenerator's throw. Reading "no body" as "throws" inverts the
// verdict. So a declaration resolves into exactly one of:
//
//	BODY     a partial declaration whose own text opens a block
//	INTEROP  a bodyless partial carrying [LibraryImport] or [DllImport] -- realized by the generator
//	NONE     bodyless with neither -- PartialStubGenerator's throw, which is what "dead" means here
//
// The control plants an interop realization precisely because that bucket is the one C1's fault could
// not see; a two-bucket scanner passes this guard's corpus arm and fails that plant.
//
// WHAT IS ASSERTED, AND WHAT IS ONLY PRINTED. Asserted: asmstdcall is declared, bodyless, and
// unrealized in both buckets. Printed as readings and asserted by nothing -- the stdcallN call-site
// count and the interop declarations -- because they move with ordinary corpus work and a guard that
// asserts a population it was asked to observe becomes a chore rather than a watch.
//
// RETIREMENT: the ж-box arc's native box kind for a reference-bearing pointee at a native boundary,
// post-hop, which is the same exit F3's disclosure names. Until then this gate is what keeps the
// runtime's fork (ii) sites honestly classified as dead rather than silently assumed so.
//
// THE OTHER TWO FLAVOURS ARE NOT THIS SHAPE and are deliberately absent: darwin's gate (libcCall,
// runtime/darwin/libccall_impl.cs:99) IS realized over golib's dispatcher, so its 46 sites are LIVE
// and owed a per-site census; linux has no single gate at all -- per-symbol stubs, six realized by
// hand-own bodies and thirty-nine not, plus DISPLACEMENT, where a stub stays bodyless forever because
// its callers were replaced (futex behind runtime/linux/lock_futex_impl.cs). Each gets its own
// instrument; one guard spanning three mechanisms would rest each arm on a different reading and fail
// as one. Measured in q90 step 2, mailbox 83c8d047f.

// gateDeclPattern matches a partial member declaration by name. The parameter list must HUG the name
// (a converted signature can open with a TUPLE return type, so a pattern that stops at the first
// `(` reads the member's name as `static`), and the pattern deliberately does NOT forbid parentheses
// earlier in the line, which is the other half of the same fault.

// second, NARROWER spelling of the same rule until the fold; the note on that declaration keeps
