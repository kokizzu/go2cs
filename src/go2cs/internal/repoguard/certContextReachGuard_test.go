// WHY A REACH GUARD AND NOT A COMPANION. q86's census (nativeBoundaryBoxDeref_test.go) declares two
// native-boundary fork (ii) sites, both producing a ж<CertContext> over an address crypt32 returned.
// The remedy for that class is a blittable mirror transcribed on arrival -- and F3 was ordered to
// write it, until the companion it would have extended turned out to rule on the question already:
//
//	"a context this file did not build -- CertCreateCertificateContext's, a plain native box nothing
//	 reads through -- keeps working unchanged and needs no hand-own"
//	     -- syscall/windows/zsyscall_windows_certchain_impl.cs:79, restated at :273
//
// C1 measured the reach rather than taking the header's word for it, and the header is right. The
// defect in fork (ii) is a WRONG FIELD OFFSET; if no field is ever read through the box, it cannot
// fire. Both consumers of the one member that HAS callers are themselves hand-owned and hand the
// pointer straight back to crypt32 through nativeIdentityOf, whose documented fallback answers a
// native box with its own address -- which is the address crypt32 gave. These two sites are that
// fallback's only live case, and the companion cites them as the evidence its pointer model works.
//
// So COORD ruled (b) at the reading (mailbox b21442c1c -> 94b1c223a): DISCLOSE the two sites as
// INERT and cut no remedy, because a remedy for a defect that cannot fire -- bought by reversing a
// documented design decision without its author and deleting the proof that the design works -- is
// the opposite of the durable path. The durable closure of the CLASS is the converter's: the ж-box
// arc's native box kind for a reference-bearing pointee at a native boundary, post-hop, which
// retires this disclosure BY CONSTRUCTION.
//
// A disclosure is only honest while it is still true, and what makes it true is a property of the
// CALLERS, not of the wrapper: Go's own root_windows.go could grow a field read on any hop. So the
// disclosure is re-measured on every run by this guard, which CAN go red:
//
//	A FIELD READ through either box is RED whatever the row's status. A disclosed row can never
//	quietly cover a new hazard at the same site, because the guard classifies every use site and a
//	read is the defect regardless of what the row says.
//
//	A NEW USE SITE of any kind is RED as UNDECLARED. A human reads it: an address-only handoff is
//	re-stamped deliberately, a read moves the row to HAZARD and the census refuses until a companion
//	lands.
//
// WHAT IS DECLARED, AND WHY BY KIND RATHER THAN BY LINE. The reach reading below enumerates each
// member's use sites by KIND -- producing call; address-only handoff to a NAMED hand-owned consumer
// -- so a line move is not a red and a NEW USE is. The named consumers are not a hardcoded list
// either: the guard requires each one to be DECLARED in a file carrying the hand-own module marker,
// derived with q86's own handOwnMarkerPattern, so a consumer that stops being hand-owned stops
// counting as an address-only handoff.
//
// THE SCOPE OF A USE. Uses are resolved within the ENCLOSING MEMBER of the producing call, not
// across the file. root_windows.cs is why: it binds `ctx` from CertCreateCertificateContext at :52
// and re-uses the same name at :284 for a chain context out of an unrelated loop. A file-wide scan
// would attribute that to this member and report a use nobody wrote. The control plants exactly
// that shape.

// certContextProducerPattern binds the variable a producing call writes its context into, in either
// spelling the converter emits: `var (leafCtx, err) = …` and `(var ctx, errΔ1) = …`.
var certContextProducerPattern = regexp.MustCompile(`(?:var\s*\(\s*([A-Za-z_\p{L}][A-Za-z0-9_\p{L}]*)|\(\s*var\s+([A-Za-z_\p{L}][A-Za-z0-9_\p{L}]*))\s*,[^)]*\)\s*=`)
