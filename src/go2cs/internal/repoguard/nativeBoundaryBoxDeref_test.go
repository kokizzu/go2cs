// THE CLASS THIS GUARDS (the native-boundary class, fork (ii)): a wrapper takes an address the KERNEL
// produced and reinterprets it as a converted record --
//
//	context = (ж<CertContext>)(uintptr)((@unsafe.Pointer)r0);
//
// That is correct exactly when the record's managed layout IS its native one. It is not, the moment the
// converted struct is REFERENCE-BEARING: a struct holding a ж<T>, array<T>, slice<T>, @string or map<>
// field carries a managed reference, so the CLR gives it AUTO layout and its fields do not sit at the
// native offsets. The read then returns plausible garbage -- no exception, no token refusal, a wrong
// answer. The remedy is the one the landed companions use: a [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)]
// blittable mirror with its size ASSERTED, transcribed into the managed record on arrival.
//
// Fork (iii) -- handing the kernel a managed pointer TOKEN as an argument -- is a different defect and
// is already answered at run time by refuseManagedPointerTokens (syscall/windows/dll_windows.cs), which
// throws. Fork (ii) has no such door: nothing at run time can tell a native address from a wrong one.
// That is why it needs a census.
//
// PROVENANCE. C1's family sizing (coord-queue q86; the sizing at 3480c8ddb6 §3) declared 7 members. C1
// re-measured them member by member at 6ba5a80 and read 2: F1's companion took the TOKEN_GROUPS and
// SID_IDENTIFIER_AUTHORITY pair and F2's took Hostent, Protoent and Servent, leaving the CertContext
// pair, which is F3's scope. COORD ordered the census cut at e437773ee. The declared set below is that
// 2, re-measured at this tree by this file's own scanner -- not carried over from the reading.
//
// THE THREE NARROWINGS, each measured before it was adopted:
//
//	(1) COMMENTS EXCLUDED. The raw pattern reads 21 lines in scope and 5 of them are prose, including
//	    F2's own companion header, which quotes the defective line verbatim so the remedy can name what
//	    it replaces. A census counting its own documentation reports the class GROWING as it is cured.
//
//	(2) THE POINTEE MUST BE REFERENCE-BEARING, resolved from its declaration rather than guessed from
//	    its name -- and resolved TRANSITIVELY. A struct whose own fields are all scalars is still auto
//	    laid out if one of them is a named struct that holds a reference. Measured at this tree by this
//	    file's own scanner, and printed by the guard on every run: the only-nested population is 258
//	    struct names, so the case is not hypothetical. It also cannot change a verdict IN SCOPE today,
//	    and the reason is worth stating precisely rather than as "no difference": of the ten code sites
//	    in scope exactly ONE names a struct at all -- CertContext, twice -- and it is DIRECTLY
//	    reference-bearing; the other eight pointees are machine scalars. Transitivity is therefore
//	    adopted for soundness while being population-preserving, and it can only ever report MORE.
//
//	(3) HAND-OWN COMPANIONS EXCLUDED: their ж<T> machinery IS the remedy, not a member of the class.
//	    The test is the module attribute AS DECLARED -- at the start of a line, in either committed
//	    spelling, `[module: GoManualConversion]` or `[module: go.GoManualConversion]`. Two ways to spell
//	    that test wrong were found by measuring it, one of them by this guard's own first red:
//
//	    ⚠ THE SPELLING. Measured at this tree: 151 files declare the attribute, 129 qualified and 22
//	    unqualified -- and all five companions in scope use the QUALIFIED form. A test written on the
//	    unqualified spelling alone excludes 22 files, none of them in scope, and reports five deliberate
//	    sites as hazards.
//
//	    ⚠ THE MENTION. A test that asks whether the marker appears ANYWHERE in the file excludes 233
//	    files rather than 151, because a GENERATED file names the marker in the placeholder comment it
//	    leaves where a hand-converted member used to be. In scope six generated files do this, and the
//	    worst of them is zsyscall_windows.cs, which mentions it THIRTY times and declares it never -- the
//	    one file holding both members of the declared set. This guard's first run against the corpus made
//	    exactly that mistake and reported 14 hand-own suppressions, 2 code sites and ZERO hazards. It was
//	    caught because the declared set then read DECLARED BUT NOT MEASURED, which is the arithmetic the
//	    declared set exists for: a census with nothing to find and a census that cannot see are the same
//	    number, and only a declared population tells them apart.
//
//	    The `_impl.cs` SUFFIX is not the test either: 11 committed `_impl.cs` files declare no marker,
//	    being partial-class companions that displace no file.
//
// SCOPE, AND THE BLIND SPOT IT BUYS. The census walks the two Windows syscall trees, which is where the
// corpus's kernel boundary lives. Corpus-wide the same pattern matches hundreds of code sites whose
// pointee is reference-bearing, and they are almost all Go's OWN runtime walking memory it allocated
// (mheap, mspan, arenaHint, heapArena, persistentalloc …) -- converted, not a native boundary, and a
// different question. Two out-of-scope readings are named here rather than left silent:
//
//	net/windows/interface_windows_impl.cs reinterprets a NativeMemory buffer as windows.IpAdapterAddresses,
//	which is reference-bearing. It is a hand-own companion and narrowing (3) would exclude it anyway.
//
//	runtime/windows/os_windows.cs profilem() builds a ж<context> over a byte array and hands it to
//	_GetThreadContext. runtime's `context` holds array<byte> and array<m128a>, so it IS reference-bearing
//	and this IS fork (ii)'s shape in the converted runtime. It is reported to COORD as a finding rather
//	than silently scoped away or silently declared; widening the census to runtime/ would bury the two
//	real members under ~34 allocator sites that are not the class.
//
// The other blind spot is narrowing (3) itself: a DEFECTIVE hand-own companion is invisible here. The
// compensating control is that companions land as reviewed cuts with a compile and a run proven on a
// scratch merge before the merge.
//
// CONTROLS. TestBoxDerefScannerFires drives the same scanner over a synthetic tracked tree and requires
// it to report (a) a member the fleet actually cured, planted with its original text, (b) a pointee
// whose reference arrives ONLY through a nested named type, and (c) a pointee that resolves nowhere, as
// unresolved rather than as benign; and requires it NOT to report (d) the KNOWN NEGATIVE from the real
// corpus -- the syntactically identical blittable line the tree carries four times today -- nor (e) the
// same hazard text inside a line comment or a block comment, nor (f) the same hazard text in a file
// carrying either spelling of the hand-own marker. A plant proves the predicate CAN fire; (d) is what
