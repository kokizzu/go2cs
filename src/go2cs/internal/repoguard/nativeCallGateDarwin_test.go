// DARWIN'S NATIVE CALL GATE, AND THE FOURTEEN SITES BEHIND IT.
//
// THE CLASS, AND WHICH FORK OF IT. A converted wrapper hands the kernel a managed struct BY ADDRESS.
// When the pointee is reference-bearing -- it holds a ж<T>, array<T>, slice<T>, @string or map<> --
// the CLR gives the managed record AUTO layout, so the address does not describe the native record
// and libc reads the wrong offsets. That is fork (i) of the native-boundary class, and it is what
// this file measures. It is NOT the fork q86 measured: nativeBoundaryBoxDeref_test.go reads fork
// (ii), a kernel-RETURNED address reinterpreted as a managed record, which is why its predicate is a
// cast `(ж<T>)(uintptr)` and this one is a parameter type. One class, two directions across the
// same boundary, and they share the layout rule -- referenceBearing -- and nothing else.
//
// THE GATE, AND WHY THIS IS A CENSUS AND NOT A WATCH. Windows has ONE gate (asmstdcall) and it is
// DEAD, so nativeCallGateWindows_test.go watches the GATE -- it asserts the declaration is bodyless
// and unrealized in both buckets, and PRINTS its 102 stdcallN call sites as a reading it does not
// assert, precisely because a dead gate makes the site count not worth gating on.
// Darwin's gate is libcCall, and it is REALIZED -- a bodied hand-own at
// src/core/runtime/darwin/libccall_impl.cs, on golib's platform-neutral dispatcher. Every site behind
// it is LIVE, so the darwin reading has to be per-site. That distinction is asserted, not assumed:
// TestDarwinLibcCallGateIsRealized fails if the gate ever goes bodyless, because a census of live
// sites taken over a dead gate is measuring a different flavour and would read as good news.
//
// WHY THE POINTEE IS READ FROM THE MEMBER SIGNATURE AND NOT THE ARGS STRUCT. Go's //go:cgo_unsafe_args
// block lift flattens every parameter into a machine word, and the converter reproduces it:
//
//	[GoType("dyn")] internal partial struct pthread_attr_init_args {
//	    internal uintptr attr;                                        <- the type is GONE here
//	}
//	internal static int32 pthread_attr_init(ж<pthreadattr> Ꮡattr) {   <- and it is HERE
//	    ref var args = ref heap(new pthread_attr_init_args((uintptr)Ꮡattr.OrTypedNil()), out var Ꮡargs);
//	    var ret = libcCall((@unsafe.Pointer)abi.FuncPCABI0(pthread_attr_init_trampoline), …);
//
// C1's first darwin census looked in the args struct and read ZERO pointer-to-reference-bearing sites
// across the whole population -- a zero that was refuted by libccall_impl.cs's own remedy list naming
// five members of the class. The lesson is recorded because the route matters: a census whose finding
// is a zero must be checked against a KNOWN POSITIVE from another population.
//
// ⚠ THE ARITHMETIC IS CORRECTED HERE, AND THE CORRECTION IS THE FIRST THING THIS FILE OWES A READER.
// q90 (2) (mailbox 2ae99188f) reported "46 libcCall sites = 7 + 0 + 7 + 32", and the 32-clear bucket
// was written as including "libcCall's own body". libcCall's own body is the DECLARATION, not a call
// site: it is what the 45 callers call. Measured at this tree by a call-shaped predicate, the
// population is 45 CALL SITES = 14 reference-bearing + 31 clear. The declared set of fourteen -- the
// number that carries the verdict -- is UNAFFECTED; what moves is the denominator, by one, in the
// direction that makes the guard's own log honest. The prediction on record (mailbox, q90 (b)) said
// 46/14/32 and is falsified on the denominator alone, by this cause, stated before the count is read
// anywhere else.
//
// THE TWO KINDS. Every row here is a HAZARD -- a defect awaiting its companion, a population that
// SHRINKS to zero and NEVER grows. An undeclared site in the class is a defect to fix, not a row to
// add; a row whose remedy lands is deleted IN THE SAME COMMIT that cures it. Each row also carries
// its REMEDY, which is what makes it HAZARD-DEFERRED rather than merely known: the darwin axis's
// increment 6 native mirror, per libccall_impl.cs's own pending list. No row here is
// DISCLOSED-INERT -- that kind (q86's CertContext pair) needs a reach reading proving nothing reads
// through the box, and no such reading can be taken on darwin while its run layer is unbuilt.
//
// ⚠ WHERE THE SEVEN UNNAMED MEMBERS ARE NAMED, and why it is here rather than in the file whose
// header names the other seven. libccall_impl.cs's header names FIVE pointee TYPES as pending
// (itimerval, keventt, stackt, pthreadattr; usigactiont done), which reach SEVEN members. C1's
// q90 (2) reading found SEVEN MORE members in the same class that the header does not name -- the
// pthread mutex/cond family -- and COORD ruled them SAME CLASS BY SHAPE at mailbox fcc021277 §4. They
// are named in THIS file's declared set, and libccall_impl.cs is not edited, for three reasons:
// (1) a comment-only edit to a hand-owned C# file buys a compile another lane must run for no
// behavioural change; (2) the guard is the thing that goes red, so the reader who needs the seven is
// already reading it; (3) that header is the DARWIN AXIS's record of its own remedy work, and the
// seven are not remedies it has planned -- writing them there would put one lane's reading inside
// another owner's plan. This file CITES the header rather than extending it.
//
// WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED. That libc reads through any of the fourteen. That is a run-time reading nobody
// can take while darwin's run layer is unbuilt. The rows are HAZARD-DEFERRED and DISCLOSED, remedied
// by the darwin axis's increment, and this guard says exactly that in its own red.
//
// CONTROLS, both of them. TestDarwinLibcCallScannerFires drives the SAME scanner over a synthetic
// tracked tree and requires it to REPORT (a) a member whose pointee is reference-bearing through a
// plain field, (b) a member whose pointee is reference-bearing ONLY through an INITIALIZED array
// field -- pthreadattr's real shape, and the arm the q86 field-pattern fix bought -- (c) a member
// whose pointee is reference-bearing only through a NESTED named type (itimerval through timeval),
// and (d) a pointee that resolves nowhere, as unresolved rather than as benign; and requires it NOT
// to report (e) an all-scalar pointee, nor (f) a call in a line comment, a block comment or a
// TRAILING comment on a line of code. It further requires the three bucketed counts to be exact --
// hand-own 1 and declaration 1, each COUNTED and not gated, so two populations are never folded into
// one number. TestRealizationBucketReadsBothBraceStyles is the control on the GATE test's own
// predicate, over K&R, Allman, a signature spanning lines, a bodyless declaration and both spellings
// of the interop attribute. The real corpus's 31 clear sites are the KNOWN NEGATIVE that proves the
// predicate is a rule and not a plant-detector.
//
// RED-FIRST, TAKEN AT THE REAL CORPUS AND RESTORED BYTE-IDENTICAL. A gate that has never been made
// to fail proves nothing, so three deliberate regressions were run against src/core itself before
// this file was committed (sys_darwin.cs sha256 f37bfa80f30ed40a5…, libccall_impl.cs
// 940646ce4eaffaa80…, both restored and re-read identical):
//

//	                                                     site: runtime/darwin/sys_darwin.cs:549 open
//	                                                     -> ж<keventt>"

//
// ⚠ AND THE FIRST TWO TOGETHER ARE THE ARGUMENT FOR THE DECLARED SET. Run at the same time they move
// the census by NOTHING -- one clear site became reference-bearing and one reference-bearing site
// became clear, so the log still read "45 = 14 + 31" while TWO members were wrong. A guard that
// asserted the COUNT would have passed. Only the by-name arms caught it, which is why every row here
// is a member and not a tally.
//
// ⚠ HOW MUCH OF THIS CENSUS THE q86 FIELD-PATTERN FIX BUYS, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSERTED. The
// file-pattern fix at 292756d64 -- admitting a field that carries an initializer -- is reverted to its
// pre-fix spelling in nativeBoundaryBoxDeref_test.go and this guard re-run against the same corpus:
//
//	with the fix     call sites 45 = reference-bearing 14 + clear 31 · parameters 21   (green)
//	without it       call sites 45 = reference-bearing  2 + clear 43 · parameters  4   (TWELVE rows
//	                 DECLARED BUT NOT MEASURED)
//
// The two that survive the revert are stackt and keventt, whose reference is a plain UNINITIALIZED
// `ж<byte>` field. Every other pointee in the set -- pthreadattr, pthreadmutex, pthreadmutexattr,
// pthreadcond, pthreadcondattr and (through timeval) itimerval -- is reference-bearing ONLY through an
// `array<T> x = new(N);`, so twelve of fourteen hazards are invisible to the pre-fix pattern. Restored
// byte-identical afterwards (sha256 695fbf907cfdfd11c…). This is also the arm the prediction on record
// named as a falsifier, taken as a measurement rather than left as a claim.
//
// THE PREDICATE IS CONSULTED, NOT COPIED. buildStructTable, referenceBearing, blittablePointees,
// memberHeaderPattern, simpleName and readTrackedText are nativeBoundaryBoxDeref_test.go's, used
// here directly. A second copy of a layout rule drifts, and a drifted instrument files its own target
// under the SOUND bucket -- the worst direction for an instrument whose finding is a zero.

// libcCallSitePattern matches a CALL of the gate. The word boundary keeps GoLibcCall.* out, and the
