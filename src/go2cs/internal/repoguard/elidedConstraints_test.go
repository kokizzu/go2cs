// RED 8 (d): the elided-constraint ratchet.
//
// Before RED 8 (a), a generic whose constraint is a method-set interface over a union of pointer-to-
// named terms lost that constraint at emission: the declaration kept `new()` and the real constraint
// went into a COMMENT, `where P : /* Point[P] */ new()`. The C# that results compiles and accepts
// type arguments Go would reject, so the loss is silent at every gate the corpus runs. RED 8 (a)
// renders those constraints for real; this guard holds the result.
//
// THE POPULATION BEFORE THE CURE, on the record from three lanes and four instruments (C1's textual
// census and the converter's own :1204 diagnostic at 8e1eafae30, C2's constraint-side reading at
// 57dd991807 and its three-target arm at 1a95944e50, G's declaration split and seed control at
// 61f00a0ace and d4cb0939e1): EXACTLY 29 sites -- crypto/internal/fips140/ecdsa 17,
// crypto/internal/fips140/ecdh 6, crypto/ecdsa 6 -- spelled 23 bare `Point[P]` and 6 qualified
// `ecdsa.Point[P]`, identical on windows, linux and darwin.
//
// WHAT THIS GUARD IS, stated so it is not read as more: a RATCHET. It holds that the elision does not
// come back. It does not prove RED 8 (a) cured anything -- that is (a)'s own A/B and i9's gate build.
//
// TWO FORMS, ONE GATED. The converter has a SECOND, legitimate erasure for pointer-core constraints
// (`/* where P : *T (erased: P renders as ж<T>) */`), which moves the whole clause into a comment
// rather than reducing it to `new()`. That form is REPORTED here and NOT gated: it is a deliberate
// emission with its own precedent. Reporting it is what gives the guard's zero for that form a
// meaning -- C1 read 0 for it at 8e1eafae30 and said the zero was WEAK because the predicate had
// never been shown to fire. TestElidedConstraintScannerFiresOnBothForms plants both and requires
// both to be seen, which is what retires that weakness (COORD's addition, 429f995).
//
// AND A KNOWN NEGATIVE FROM THE REAL CORPUS, the second control COORD's v2 lesson requires
// (6a3706de6c): a plant proves a predicate CAN fire, not that it is the RULE. At the version tip 144
// lines carry a commented constraint -- `where X : /* … */` -- and only 29 are the elision. The other
// 115 are the converter's ordinary breadcrumb, a Go constraint rendered as a comment with the REAL C#
// clause after it (`where E : /* cmp.Ordered */ IAdditionOperators<E, E, E>, …`). The rule is what
// FOLLOWS the comment: `new()` and nothing else. The control plants one of those 115 shapes and
// requires it NOT to match, so the guard is shown to discriminate against the near-miss class the
// corpus actually contains rather than only against a clean line.

// elidedConstraintPattern is the GATED form: a type-parameter constraint reduced to `new()` with the
// real constraint left in a comment beside it.
// `.*?` and not `[^*]*`, for the reason the erased form's predicate taught an hour after this one was
// written: a class excluding `*` cannot cross a pointer type inside the comment. MEASURED at the
// version tip before the change: 0 of the 29 gated matches carry an asterisk inside their comment, so
// the two spellings read the same population TODAY and the non-greedy one cannot start hiding members
// tomorrow.
var elidedConstraintPattern = regexp.MustCompile(`where\s+[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*\s*:\s*/\*.*?\*/\s*new\(\)`)

// erasedConstraintPattern is the REPORTED form: the pointer-core erasure, whole clause commented.
// ⚠ `[^*]*` CANNOT BE USED HERE, and the control is what found that out. The erased clause's own
// constraint text is a Go POINTER type -- `*nistec.P256Point` -- so a character class excluding `*`
// stops dead at the asterisk and the predicate never matches. The first run of the plant COORD added
// refused the pattern on its first use: the zero this column read against the corpus was not merely
// unproven, it came from a predicate that could not have fired. Non-greedy `.*?` crosses the
// asterisk and still stops at the first `*/`, and `.` does not cross a newline, so the match stays
// on one line.
